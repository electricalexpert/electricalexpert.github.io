<p>2500-joule energy rating provides maximum protection of all your sensitive electronic devices. In order to understand which generator transfer switch is best for your installation, it's recommended to speak with a generator specialist. It was in the UK in 1881, that a Siemens AC alternator was used to light up a street electrically for the first time. Even if you turn off power, electrical wiring can be tricky and is best left to the professionals. The TLC folks promptly responded and scheduled a time to repair or replace right away.</p>
