So before the next threat of severe storms and power outages, give us a call to get a backup generator installed for your home. The Office of Professional and Occupational Regulation wants to make sure that individuals who have military experience and training and who wish to obtain a electricians license receive appropriate credit for their military training and experience.</p>
