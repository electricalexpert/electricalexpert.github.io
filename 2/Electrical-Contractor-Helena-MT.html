<p>Parallel wiring is the standard for 120 volt circuits in the entire house, making possible the independent use of all appliances, supplied by the same voltage. That is why it is said that electricity is always looking for a path to ground (lower potential). Reach out to the professionals at All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating to learn more about our comprehensive electrical services and how they can help your home run more efficiently. The source for the circuit is at the switch and 2-wire cable runs to each receptacle outlet.</p>

For basic generator installations we install a power inlet for your portable generator to plug into during a power outage. The fixtures are designed to withstand moisture, but calcium and lime deposits; hard water scale and dirt will build up on the lenses, dramatically reducing the light output. Not only can preventive electrical maintenance save businesses time and money, but by keeping equipment functioning properly, the risk of hazard is greatly reduced and the work environment becomes a safer place.</p>
<p>Plus home generators run on propane or natural gas, so there's no refueling. Aging, outdated electrical equipment can be modernized to new technology, dramatically improving its performance and lifetime. In a building whose lights (or other devices) are controlled by a low-voltage system, one or more of these 120VAC electrical circuits will power one or more low voltage transformers that in turn will provide low voltate (24VAC) to operate switches and relays controllilng the building lighting system.</p>
