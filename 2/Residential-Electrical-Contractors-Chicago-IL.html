Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
<p>Our training courses prepare maintenance personnel to successfully maintain and repair industrial electrical equipment, improve workforce safety and decrease downtime. Solar path lights are a great way to help reduce your energy usage. The Load terminals (red arrows near the top of our photo at left) on an electrical receptacle are for the outgoing wires.
