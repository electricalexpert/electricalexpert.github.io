The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>
<p>A ground fault circuit interrupter outlet, or GFCI, is a circuit breaker outlet. Electrical Contractor: You need to complete 4,000 hours of work as a journeyman electrician with 2,000 hours specializing in commercial work.

Arc faults occur when an electrical circuit veers off its intended path, often through a breach in the wiring. Upgrading the electrical equipment in your home provides for greater flexibility within your home so you can accomplish more around the house without fear of electrical shock or fire.</p>
