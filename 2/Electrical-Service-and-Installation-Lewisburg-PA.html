Millions of people every year lose electrical power to their homes very often for a long time if they don't have a generator to fall back on during these emergency conditions. The following are some safety tips to consider when using electrical outlets, electrical cords and extension cords.</p>

<h3>Electrical Equipment Company Lewisburg PA 17837</h3>
<p>Fuse boxes; especially those that were installed prior to 1960, need to be upgraded to circuit breakers for added safety. Even with an all-LED lighting scheme running on DC circuits, the house would still need conventional 120-volt AC current for appliances and other plug-in devices. The variety of applications is significant as a result, ranging from decorative street lighting, commercial parking lot lighting, car lot lighting, outdoor landscape lighting, architectural lighting, security lighting, and general site lighting.</p>
