Unlike whole-house generators, you have to manually add fuel to your portable generator before each use.

The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>Some electricians — especially those who haven't been around for a while or who aren't really savvy with the code — will steer customers in a different direction just for not having the correct knowledge,” Volpe says. Can provide service for the lifetime of the generator. This is because these circuits will likely take appliances that draw greater amperage. Before decorating, check each light strand for broken sockets, frayed cords, or faulty plugs.
