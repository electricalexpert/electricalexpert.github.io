You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel. Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sized in amperes (amps), a unit that measures the flow of electrical current. Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights.
