These types of warning signs could be the start of something a lot more damaging, like an electrical fire or other safety hazards that can affect you and your family.

<p>If your transformer low voltage side feeds ( hooks up to ) a relay, then you'd take the farthest lights away from that relay and hook them up BACK to that same relay where the circuit takes off to feed the first lights. But none of these lights can compare to the LED light bulb. Check electrical cords to make sure they are not running across doorways or under carpets where they are can get damaged. In the safe use of electricity in the home, circuit breakers should be used to terminate power to outlets.</p>
