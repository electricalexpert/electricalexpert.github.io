<p>The Electrical Safety Foundation International is a non-profit organization dedicated exclusively to promoting electrical safety at home and in the workplace. Improper Installation ­- Right from the start, if the wiring on your breaker panel is not done correctly, it can cause numerous problems for you. In most homes, lighting and small appliance circuits are 15 or 20 amps, and major appliances are on 20, 50 or even 60 amp circuits. This in turn paves the way for the most sophisticated lighting ever developed on our world, and quite possibly, the singular source of lighting used both commercially and residentially in the very near future: LED commercial lighting fixtures.</p>

A: Anyone who will perform nonexempt electrical work without supervision by a licensed electrician or master electrician DOES require a license. Proof of general liability insurance in the minimum amount of two hundred fifty thousand dollars ($250,000.00) shall be a requirement for obtaining and renewing an electrical license.</p>
<p>This means that 12-gauge wire will work for your landscape lighting system. Outdoor landscape lights are used to highlight trees, gardens, fountains, walkways and anything else that you want to call attention to. Not only are these lights beautiful in their own right, but they also increase general nighttime visibility, which improves safety and discourages would-be intruders. The Electrical Safety Foundation International found that each day, seven children must be treated for injuries caused by electrical shock.</p>
<p>When there is a blackout, a home backup generator will provide enough power. And because the switches are momentary contact, the switch returns to the center after flicking lights on or off. Home standby generators provide homeowners reliable backup power to keep them comfortable, safe, and secure during a power outage.
