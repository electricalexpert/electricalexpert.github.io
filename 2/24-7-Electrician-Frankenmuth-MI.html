<p>If your outlet only has one colored wire (whether black or red) it is either not switched at all or the entire outlet is being switched. Beginning October 1, 2017, all examinations for state electrical licenses will be based on the 2017 NEC. It's a thin piece of wire designed to carry a limited electrical current. There are different types of electrical lights as well as different types of power sources, such generators, to power important equipment if the power does go out.</p>

If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
