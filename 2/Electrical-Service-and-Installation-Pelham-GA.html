<h3>Generator Installation And Repair Service In Pelham GA 31779</h3>
<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>You may want to consider purchasing a battery backup surge protector to safeguard your computer against potential loss of data during a momentary loss of power as a result of an electrical storm or accidental power outage. If your system was not installed by a licensed electrician - many low voltage systems are installed by gardeners, landscape irrigates and by homeowners themselves - choose a reputable outdoor lighting company that offers a maintenance plan to keep your system looking great and performing optimally.</p>
