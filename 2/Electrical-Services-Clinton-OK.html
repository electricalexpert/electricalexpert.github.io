We will review your unique situation and offer you an honest estimate on an electrical service upgrade that we guarantee will be completed on schedule.

Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors.

A properly functioning electrical panel is essential to the safety of your family and your home. Or study materials recommended by such industry pillars as the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) prior to taking the journeymen electrician license test. Intermittent humming or crackling noises coming from the electrical panel are reasons to call an electrician immediately.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors.
