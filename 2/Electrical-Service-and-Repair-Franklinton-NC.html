Short circuits are dangerous with high voltage power sources because the high currents encountered can cause large amounts of heat energy to be released.

You can substitute up to 1,000 hours of experience for graduating from a two-year program at an approved electrical school. Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs. After completing this course, participants should be able to explain the basic principles of motor operation and describe the basic operation of a simple alternating current (AC) motor and a simple direct current (DC) motor.</p>

These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
