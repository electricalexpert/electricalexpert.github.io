<p>Standby generators don't need to be hooked up every time you need power. By diverting excess pressure in the hose (your home's wires) surge protectors safeguard wiring and appliances. Today's electronics, appliances, lighting and remodeling needs may leave your existing electrical service panel underpowered. To take a specialty journeyman electrician license test, trainees must have worked under the supervision of a licensed journeyman electrician or the appropriate specialty electrician for at approx.</p>

This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own.

This wiring diagram shows electrical power entering the ceiling light electrical box and then continues to a wall switch using a 3 conductor cable. The copper wire is called the ground wire because it is connected to the earth either directly or through another grounded conductor.
