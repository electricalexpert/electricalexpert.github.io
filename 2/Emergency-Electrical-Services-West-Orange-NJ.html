Our Virginia Beach electricians are prepared to walk you through and conduct every step of the selection and installation process if you are looking to purchase or replace a generator. Avoid overloading double adapters or power boards with too many appliances as this can cause fires.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running. Overloading and doubling up of circuits is commonly seen on older outdated fuse panels, the result of improper installations that were never inspected. You can pick one up for a few bucks and use it to test for hot wires or to find a neutral.</p>
<p>Commercial indoor lighting maintenance- Includes regular inspections, fixture cleaning and bulb replacement. There are also voltage testers available that you can place on a wire and it will let you know if electricity is running through it.

It is better to install both types, external protection, as mentioned above; and point-of-use protection, which is a single surge protector that plugs into an outlet. If you aren't sure of normal circuit wire size, use the #15 ampere Type-S time-delay fuse. A more advanced industrial electrician will be strongly involved in the control wiring and operation of process equipment.</p>
