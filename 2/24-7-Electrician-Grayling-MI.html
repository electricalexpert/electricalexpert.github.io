Yup, they're definitely not the cheapest in town, but I've used a few other plumbers over the years to try and save money, and inevitably they turned out to be less professional and sometimes downright shady, a few even causing issues that needed further work because of their ineptitude.</p>

Or, you must meet the qualifications to be licensed as a journeyman electrician with 8,000 hours of journeyman experience. So, using the 200 watts from our earlier example, we'll add 25%: 200 x.25 = 50. Now, we have 200 watts for our light fixtures and 50 watts for our wiring, for a total of 250 watts.</p>

Putting it into easily digestible words, a standby generator works with two major parts: it works with the generator itself and with a transfer switch. Be conscientious because, even though you've got the power off to the circuit you're working on, there are most likely wires behind your wall, and you don't want to get into a live circuit behind your wall.</p>
<p>If the power is in the receptacle box, use a 3 wire cable between receptacle box and switch box.
