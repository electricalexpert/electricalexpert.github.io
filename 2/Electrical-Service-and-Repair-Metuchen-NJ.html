<p>Surge protectors are typically installed connected to a home's electrical service box. You can imagine these little wires that lead through your house to your electrical outlet are going to be a lot like the veins and capillaries of your house leading back to the main arteries that connect to the electrical panel. Brighten up exterior spaces to provide the safety and security you need at night while highlighting trees and shrubs. Today's computers, appliances and home theater equipment are more sophisticated than ever and are especially vulnerable to electrical surges.</p>
<p>At all boxes, there must be minimum wire length of six inches including the grounding conductors. These types of outdoor led lights can also emit a higher quality amount of light output that any incandescent halogen bulb can by using only 20 percent of the energy that was used by an incandescent bulb. Installed, troubleshot, maintained and repaired most types of electrical systems and equipment up to 600 volts.

We understand that electrical issues are not only a major inconvenience but can also be potential fire hazards.</p>
