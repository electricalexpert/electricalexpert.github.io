<h3>Electrical Safety In Your Home Guntersville AL 35976</h3>
<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>It's often referred to as the main breaker box or fuse box. Right before and immediately after the storm, people tend to purchase portable generators; once the debris has cleared, many purchase standby” generators, which are more powerful than portable generators (and more expensive) and are installed in the home. Whether you need help installing a light switch, wiring an outlet or running a wire to a new lighting fixture, the Handy platform will connect you with the right electrical service professional with the right experience.</p>
