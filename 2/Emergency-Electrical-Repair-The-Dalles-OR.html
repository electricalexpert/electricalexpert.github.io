<p>Improper Installation - If your home's breaker panel wasn't installed correctly the first time around, you may be experiencing frequent issues with it. Some surge protectors allow you time enough to shut down your computer without losing data or causing damage. Flickering lights, odd sounds from a fuse box, tripping breakers, and even smoke coming from outlets or outlets with burning smells are all warning signs of an outdated panel. TIP: If the wires to the power source are "plugged" into the back, then you can gently rock the power source back-and-fourth until they come free.</p>

The generator offers a power capacity of 15,300 watts on natural gas and 17,000 watts on liquid propane. For these reasons, it is imperative that the maintenance electrician, technician or engineer uses a troubleshooting methodology that enables them to isolate the problem in the shortest amount of time.</p>
