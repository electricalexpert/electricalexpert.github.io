Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>In an attempt to reduce the risk of electrocution and fires, the National Electrical Code requires specific types of outlets in certain locations. Most states require electricians to be licensed. Electrical upgrades are rarely simple. Just like your heating and cooling system is controlled by a thermostat, a Kohler generator is controlled by a transfer switch that senses when utility power fails, starting the generator automatically within seconds. This Champion Power Equipment whole house generator gets an edge over most others in its class from the fact that it provides a quieter and more residential-friendly operation with its 63 dB noise level.</p>
