<p>The diagram above shows a two conductor cable from the circuit breaker panel going to a wall switch. Some low voltage lights (like many cans and track heads, for instance) have a small transformer built into each fixture, so you just wire things up like regular lights and you can completely forget that they happen to be low voltage fixtures (with the exception of the special dimmer, if you need one). The portable generator, on the other hand, is a gas-powered unit that's mainly used to power specific items like your home appliances.</p>
<p>Check that all appliances and electric equipment are located away from the sink and bath. We can help you do this when you call us to learn more about the generators we can install for you. Low-Voltage Lighting. Because of a circuit breaker's time-delay feature, it may not need to trip for months, even years on circuits with light loads. This poses a safety issue because many old circuit breakers won't trip when they are called upon to. This could be a potential fire hazard as heat builds up possibly breaking down components of your wiring and leading to a fire.</p>
<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
