<p>A power surge, which is also called transient voltage, is basically an increase in voltage that's above the normal level of electricity flow. While a surge will not necessarily severely damage or destroy a piece of equipment right on the spot, it can peck on it for a very long time and eventually cause problems serious enough for you to notice. These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>
<p>Heavy-duty (220v, 240v, 250v): this refers to outlets that are designed for devices that draw a lot of power, such as refrigerators, dryers, and ovens.

It is useless to install solar lighting system that can not be successfully maintained for sustained operation. Most low-voltage cables at some point cross connect with devices that do carry a dangerous electrical current, such as electronic switches, multiplexing equipment and PBX private branch exchange systems,” Janeway said.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet. Also think about adding outlets inside bathroom drawers and cabinets to plug in devices like electric toothbrushes, razors, and blow dryers. Call us at (509) 362-9556 to discuss your indoor and outdoor lighting. The polarity of these wires is not important; either wire on the output side of the transformer may be connected to either wire of the low voltage circuit.
