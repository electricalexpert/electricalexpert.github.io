<p>The method you choose will depend on the type of fixtures, the distance from the transformer, and the type and size of wire. Now no surge protector will protect a system from the millions of volts created by a direct hit from lightning but a good protector will safeguard your system from most ordinary day-to-day power problems. We can help you to reduce your utility expenses by installing energy efficient lights or solar lamps. Of course, t is essential that you have proper lighting during the night, especially in outdoor spaces and pathways.</p>

Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.
