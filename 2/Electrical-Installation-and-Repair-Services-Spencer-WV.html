Superior Warranty - KOHLER generators pack more than 90 years of PROVEN performance into a truly commercial-grade power system for your home or small business.

<p>They don't necessarily break down all at once and stop working, which is why they can cause warning signs ahead of time and notify you simply on its performance if it's indeed time to upgrade it.
