<p>Commercial Generator Services: We will install, repair, replace, or service commercial generators and standby power systems. Electric panels are connected to the service meter or the electrical disconnect. Light bulbs are the most prolific electrical device in our homes, making sure they are used correctly is important.

Require a Neutral wire and are often used to replace ordinary outlet or switch.</p>
<p>Circuits are not designed to house two conductors, and one may come loose, overheat, arc, or even lead to a fire.
