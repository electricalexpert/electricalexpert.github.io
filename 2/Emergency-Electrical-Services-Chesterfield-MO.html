Residential low voltage outdoor landscape lighting, as shown in Figure 1, has grown by leaps and bounds over the last decade. The wires in the switch box are all that you have to work with. Outdoor lighting, as the name suggests, is lighting that is done to make sure that the exteriors, like the approach, porch, patio, yard, etc are lit up. This not only lights up the place, but can also add elegance to it. Let the articles below throw light on this subject.</p>
