<p>Provided that you know how to work on electrical wiring without getting killed by electrocution, you (or your electrician) will open the switch box, carefully pull the switch assembly out enough to inspect for additional wires that may be present, and then use a VOM or DMM or even a simple neon tester to determine what wires are present. We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
