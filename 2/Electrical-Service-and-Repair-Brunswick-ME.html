Some type of electrical failure or malfunction was cited as a factor contributing to ignition for 72% of electrical distribution or lighting equipment home structure fires. Most electricians work a standard 40-hour week, although overtime may be required.</p>
<p>Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits. You can design your wire route so that it reaches each fixture and then returns to the transformer.
