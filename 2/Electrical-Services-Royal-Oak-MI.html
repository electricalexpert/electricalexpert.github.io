<p>Maintenance of generator that is run on natural gas is low cost. Often gardeners, homeowners or landscape maintenance personnel accidentally knock the fixtures out of place as they go about their gardening business, bury the fixtures with mulch or debris, blow leaves on top of the fixtures or otherwise compromise the perfect aiming of the light beams onto their intended subjects. Once the charging system is installed, consumers should take safety precautions such as never using an extension cord to charge the vehicle and regularly inspecting cords and plugs for damage.</p>
<p>Landscape lighting design is very similar to the design of the landscape itself. There are generators that will run on diesel fuel but these will mainly be larger and for more industrial use than for the home.
