<p>In other words - don't continue using an aging, defective electrical panel or cuicut breaker in your home. With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes. Or maybe it's something bad, like a new electrical contractor opened up in your town and hired away some of your best people. Don't run extension cords under the rug or carpet. Electricians train to handle a wide variety of issues with electrical power, lighting and control systems.</p>
<p>So, the first rule here is not to use electrical appliances when the ground is wet.

These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
