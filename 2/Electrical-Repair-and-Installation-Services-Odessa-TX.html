<p>The popularity of outdoor living has brought a new focus to outdoor lighting. From landscape lighting to area lights and architectural sign lighting. Avoid overloading extension cords, power strips, or outlets. Most breaker boxes are 100, 150 or 200 amps. Trust Graf Electric to professionally upgrade or service any type of commercial indoor lighting. It will also give you the peace of mind that the electrical panel is not the hazard it once was.

<p>Every emergency electrician carries a wide variety of electrical parts that he can use to resolve emergency electrical situations. In outdoor settings use only outdoor approved temporary wiring and extension cords. Here at HedgeHog, we also provide commercial electrical emergency services. If you only remove the red and attach the new black where it was, it will not work - by splicing to one of the existing wires and maintaining the terminations, everything will work.</p>
