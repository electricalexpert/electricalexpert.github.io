<p>At Fox & Sons, we provide circuit breaker services and electrical renovation. For example, if your lights consume 100 watts of power, you'll need a power supply that's rated for at least 120 watts (100 x 1.2). If you're planning on adding more lights in the future, buy a transformer that's rated for more wattage than you currently need. Fortunately, with the help of an emergency electrician, you can get back to normal quickly. Completely wireless and battery powered, Generac's Wireless Monitor provides you with instant status information without ever leaving the house.</p>
<p>If there is a capped off neutral in the switch box, you can put in a second switch for another light, just as you want to do. You will have to figure out which of the existing switch wires is permanent, and hot and splice into that wire to supply the new switch. Older electrical panels can't always accommodate multiple devices like air conditioners, HDTVs, and clothes dryers running simultaneously. Try to distribute small appliances and electronic devices to several outlets to avoid overwhelming the one.</p>
