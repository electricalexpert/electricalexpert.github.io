<p>All of the power for your home comes through this panel from the utility company to the exit wires that split off and service different parts of the house. You are building a room (such as a bathroom or closet) in the same area as the existing electrical panel: Since the electrical code does not allow for an electrical panel to be located within a bathroom or a closet, no matter the size, this could be a reason for relocating the electrical panel. Adding an electrical outlet next to an existing light switch is easy, as long as there is a neutral wire in the box.</p>
<p>Like a car, an emergency standby generator is powered by internal combustion engine that can run nonstop for days at a time, so they require a considerable amount of maintenance. Electrical panels are one of those things that just work until they don't. When it detects an interruption in your main utility service, it safely switches you from that power source to the standby generator's power. Industrial projects require highly skilled personnel with Safety training and equipment.</p>

<p>Knowing the parts of sockets and switches is useful because when you dive into the projects above all about wiring and working with these parts, you will know what we are talking about. Single-phase motors are not likely to be connected to complicated motor control circuitry and will not be discussed in this text.
