<p>At NUMBER of CIRCUITS in OLD BUILDINGS , use of zip cord or extension cord mounted on or through walls and ceilings to add lighting circuits or receptacles is improper, unsafe (a fire hazard), and is often an indication that the building does not have enough circuits for modern usage. It can instantly use LP gas or natural gas, and you can switch the type of fuel in a heartbeat by a push of a button.

This entails the same preparation as the T-connector method, except you lay the cable from the transformer, along side each light fixture (one cluster per cable), and back to the transformer.

If none of that is helpful about all that is left is to run a new wire from the switch to an outlet for the disposal. Turn the power back on and wearing electrically insulated gloves with glove protectors, and a face shield CAREFULLY (You can get shocked or electrocuted) check with a volt meter or pigtail light bulb to see which wire is the LINE.</p>
