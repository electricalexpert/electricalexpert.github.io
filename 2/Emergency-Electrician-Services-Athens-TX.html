Outlets that have moisture in them may create a shock hazard. If your devices are hit with a power surge, the excess power could easily burn them out, rendering them useless. The result is damaging surges traveling to important electronics elsewhere in the house.</p>
<p>Many people who live in homes built prior to 1980 have an electrical system that is capable of providing power to outlets, but completely inadequate for today's modern appliances and electronics. As our world becomes more technologically advanced, our homes need to be able to keep up with it. While regular and modern appliances need 100-200 amps or more amps of power, fuse boxes are only designed to handle 30-60 amps of power. Electricians in Wyoming must hold a state license to work.</p>

<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
