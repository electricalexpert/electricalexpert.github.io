Solar power generators run on the same principles of a battery where energy is stored from the sun until it is needed for use of your home appliances and office equipment like computers and photocopiers.</p>
<p>As a rule of thumb, you'll want to have wiring that is long enough to extend 3 inches outside of the electrical box.
