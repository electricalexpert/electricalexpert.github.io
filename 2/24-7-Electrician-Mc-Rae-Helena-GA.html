    <meta name="description" content="Low Voltage Lighting & Wiring  Mc Rae Helena Georgia - Even the best whole house generators involve extra costs such as fuel tank installation and set up fees, consider that generators are generally a little larger than comparable AC units, and regulations usually require that they be located x amount of feet from property lines or dwellings, and concealed by fences or shrubbery, all of which can add up. Some local regulations may also include periodic inspections.">
