We understand that having an electrical issue arise after hours can be very troublesome. The panel white and black wires should never be connected together, although it is common to use a white on the wire going to the switch to splice to the panel black wire.</p>
<p>The electric panel is the beating heart of your house and it's where all the electricity flows through from the main power line.
