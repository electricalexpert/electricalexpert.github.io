<h3>Tips on Upgrading Your Electrical Panel in Kershaw SC</h3>
<p>When it's time to replace your electrical panel, our services are just a tap away. Older homes' electrical panels often top out at 60 or 100 amps, but most newer homes have 200-amp panels that meet your family's electricity needs now with plenty of room for future growth. The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>On Time Electrical offers generator installations and repairs in Charlotte that will make sure you never get stuck in the dark. Fuse boxes can only handle 30-60 amps. Refilling - Homeowners often go up in flames when refueling their generators. If you are looking for a local, professional New Jersey electrician, then Team Electric Plumbing & Air is perfect for you. When it senses this, it automatically turns off the power from the generator and transfers your home's electrical load back to the utility line.</p>

<p>Here's the best advice that I could give you, contact a licensed electrician and have them installed the proper electrical box, for you and save yourself a lot of grief.
