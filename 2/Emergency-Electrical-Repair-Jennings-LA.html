Three-phase power includes 3 AC waveforms, making 3-phase equipment better suited for intermediate and high-capacity applications with per-rack power consumption levels that surpass the practical energy limits of single-phase equipment.</p>
<p>Electrical Contractor License: It is a certificate C license that is obtained by system contractors that have one-year experience in the field and completed an exam. Alternatively, maybe you've traipsed down to the basement and discovered a different issue, such as faulty circuit breaker or outdated fuse box.

<p>Lights, like all sources of electricity, can also cause electric shock, so ensure you always turn the light switch off before replacing a light bulb, and never replace a light bulb or touch a light switch with wet hands. Whole house surge protection is a great way to ensure that the valuable appliances and equipment in your home are protected from the damaging effects of electrical spikes from the electrical utility provider and lightning strikes.
