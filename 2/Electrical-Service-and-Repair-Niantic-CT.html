<h2>How To Hire Master Electrician Contractor in Niantic</h2><p><img src="https://electricalimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/electrician.jpg" alt=""><p>

It is recommended to use a higher transformer wattage and larger cable size to allow for adding more lights. Master Electrician - You must have at least four years of experience as a licensed journeyman electrician. Attaching fixtures to one cable in a daisy chain can overpower the lights closest to the transformer and leave the last few power-starved and dim.</p>
