<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening. To use a portable generator without the hassle of running extension cords, hire an electrician to install a manual transfer switch subpanel off your main circuit panel and install a dedicated inlet to power the subpanel (installing the subpanel is complex; not a DIY project).</p>
