The voltage drop in the main power wires from the generation source or the battery to the bus should not exceed 2 percent of the regulated voltage, when the generator is carrying rated current or the battery is being discharged at the 5-minute rate.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire. MVP Electric, Heating & Cooling provides professional electrical services in Kansas City, MO and the surrounding areas.

Transformers are very convenient since they provide only a small amount of voltage to the lights as well as control the length with which the lights are turned on which allows homeowners to save up on electric bills. These run on liquid propane or gasoline, which can be in short supply during long power outages.</p>
