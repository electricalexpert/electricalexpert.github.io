<p>If it is, though, you can make any or all of the outlets half hots.

<p>It is best, then, to have a professional install these low voltage landscape lights to minimize the risk of physical equipment damage. When installing dimmers or smart dimmers, avoid CFL bulbs as they are not compatible with a lot of dimmers even though the bulbs say "dimmable." Smart light switches fall in the middle of the cost range, being less expensive than a fleet of individual bulbs and a bit pricier than smart plugs. 120 volt systems must maintain absolute moisture free which is difficult with the wires running underground.</p>

Whatever the source of fuel chosen, one thing is certain and that is that having backup electrical power available on-demand can greatly reduce the anxiety associated with an unexpected power outage. These devices often have photo cells or timers that control when the lights turn on, so you don't have to flip a switch every night.</p>
