Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities.

<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
