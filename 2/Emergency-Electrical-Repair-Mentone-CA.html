<p>It is a good idea to speak to your electrical professional about layering the whole-house surge protection, especially if there's an elaborate home entertainment system or other expensive electronic set-up. Just happened to come across this article while looking for some other information of landscape lighting and was drawn in by the clever website name (always good to be handy!) but wanted to point out a couple of small changes that can make a HUGE difference in how long your install will continue to work perfectly, or work at all.</p>
<p>We will help you to decide on whether you should have your outdated fuse panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker panel. While they are very different to the typical home consumer, a fuse box serves the same role of a circuit breaker in a building: to prevent the overloading of circuits by cutting off the flow of power and reducing risk of fire.
