Our in-house certified electricians are drilled and conversant with home, and commercial electrical rules and government accepted practices, they handle such intricate jobs. After completing this course, participants should be able to explain the basic principles of motor operation and describe the basic operation of a simple alternating current (AC) motor and a simple direct current (DC) motor.</p>

Luckily, here at Beacon Electrical Services, we can maintain and update your service panel.
