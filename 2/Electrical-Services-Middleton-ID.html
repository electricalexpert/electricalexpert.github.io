<p>Master Electrician - You must be at least 22 years of age. 4 The company was expanding rapidly, opening new branches and factories and trading in 'everything electrical', a phrase that was to become synonymous with GEC.

These lights are really easy to install, just use the stake and push them into the ground along a garden path, throughout a flower bed, or around the pool.</p>
<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>Our outdoor lighting contractors place your lights against a surface with the beams pointed up. This creates a shadow that illuminates the wall's or stone work's texture. The bare copper wire that is nearly black was a clue in tracking down a neutral and ground wiring failure at this building. Our lighting contractors are licensed, bonded and extremely professional. Group and label the wires in the switch boxes so you'll know how to connect them after the drywall is complete.</p>

After triggering, the low clamping voltage allows large current surges while limiting heat dissipation in the device. LEDs for outdoor lighting are becoming more available- but be aware that there are significant quality and color temperature differences. Lighting transformers come in a variety of sizes and you will need one big enough to handle the number and wattage of the light bulbs it will be powering.</p>
