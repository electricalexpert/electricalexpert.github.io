<p>Both outlets of the same receptacle are controlled by the existing light switch. If you're having circuit and panel capacity issues, we offer FREE in-home estimates by licensed electricians so you can be sure your home will remain safe. The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>These types of generators are adequate enough to power appliances such as refrigerators, furnaces, televisions, and sump pumps. Avoid planting trees underneath power lines or near utility equipment. The electric service panel is the connection between the external wires coming from the street and the internal wires of your home's electric system.
