This might seem like a no-brainer, but you'd be shocked by how many businesses get burned by non-licensed commercial electricians. At IEC, our mission is to provide your apprentices, journeymen and management with education, training and forums so you can build a team of professionals and excel in the electrical construction industry.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit.

Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
