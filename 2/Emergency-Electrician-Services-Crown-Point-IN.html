I like 12v landscape wired lighting far better then the new LED wireless lights, and I figured I'd share some of the problems I ran into that you can avoid :) Thanks for the read and the vote Kristen.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire.

Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>Output Volt-Amps (VA) is a measurement of electrical power and is used to size a UPS system for the equipment that will be connected to it. Plus, bigger boxes just make wiring easier, especially if they're crammed full of wires and connectors.
