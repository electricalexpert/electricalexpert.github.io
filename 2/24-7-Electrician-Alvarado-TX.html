At IEC, our mission is to provide your apprentices, journeymen and management with education, training and forums so you can build a team of professionals and excel in the electrical construction industry.</p>
<p>Never use them with extension cords. Choosing the right emergency electrician can be a very difficult decision to make especially if you are facing a stressful situation. Any electrical contractor that you hire should be technically proficient, reputable, and financially stable, and should demonstrate a thorough understanding of your business. We partner with Kohler backup generators, bringing you an efficient and reliable source of power, perfectly sized to your requirements.</p>

We understand that installing or repairing light fixtures can be disruptive to your day-to-day life and we always strive to work as efficiently and quickly as possible.
