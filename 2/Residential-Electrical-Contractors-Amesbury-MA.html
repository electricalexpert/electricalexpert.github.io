<p>Regardless of what a particular project is going to be, great lighting schemes are a result of a lighting designer that is a master of their medium, since they can meld technology, science, and artistry into one impressive package. If the current panel in your Knoxville home has been in place before you moved in 20 years ago, it might be time for an upgrade. A breaker that continues to trip on its circuit is a good sign that you may be due for a panel upgrade, as your home is not getting the power that it requires.</p>
<p>11. Connect the low-voltage wire at the end post to the transformer near an electrical outlet.

<p>It is a common wiring practice when wiring with only a two conductor cable to use the white as LINE and the black as LOAD. You already practice fire safety, but fire prevention is the best way to protect your family - and that starts with ensuring that your electrical systems and appliances are functioning properly and safely.

<p>If the duration of the increase is longer than three nanoseconds (billionths of a second) it is referred to as a "surge," if the duration is less than that, then it is considered a "spike." A surge can cause significant damage to electronic equipment (particularly computers and modern multimedia systems).
