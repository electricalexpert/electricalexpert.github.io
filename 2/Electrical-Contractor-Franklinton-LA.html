<p>Portable generators can keep you moderately comfortable, especially if you stagger usage and have an alternate heat source like a fireplace or gas logs.

You should never run a portable gas unit indoors because of the carbon monoxide fumes. Always be on the lookout for faulty electrical objects in your home or business - electrical safety should be a top priority. Residential electricians wire houses under construction, and upgrade older houses. So, you need to have a certified, licensed electrician inspect your breaker box.</p>

Fixed (standby) generators require the expertise of a seasoned electrician for the installation process.</p>
