<p>After you are registered as an apprentice, you will work for an employer who has been approved by the Area II Inside Electrical committee to be a training agent through the Bureau of Labor & Industries. Electronics must be protected from inside the home and because each member's needs will be a little different, it is the member's responsibility to purchase point of use” devices.
