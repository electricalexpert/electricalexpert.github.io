<p>Journeyman License: 5 years of working experience are required. 2. Solar Landscape Lighting - is a perfect way to bring forth light to your pathways around your house or business areas. A properly functioning electrical panel is essential to the safety of your family and your home. Or study materials recommended by such industry pillars as the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) prior to taking the journeymen electrician license test. Intermittent humming or crackling noises coming from the electrical panel are reasons to call an electrician immediately.</p>

The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
