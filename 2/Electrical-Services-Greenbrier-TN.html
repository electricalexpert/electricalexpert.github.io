Use a noncontact voltage tester like this to double-check that all wires in a box are dead” after turning off the circuit breaker. Be sure to use ‘earthed' switches and check the electrical load on the switch.</p>
<p>Like cars, standby generators run nonstop for many hours, so they have to be maintained as if they were, well, cars.
