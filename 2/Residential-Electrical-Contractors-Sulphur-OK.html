<p>Commercial Generator Services: We will install, repair, replace, or service commercial generators and standby power systems. Electric panels are connected to the service meter or the electrical disconnect. Light bulbs are the most prolific electrical device in our homes, making sure they are used correctly is important. Every home should have proper interior and exterior lighting installation. Most wall switches are rated for 15 amps.

Please take note that every wiring system you connected has its own fuse and circuit breakers. Anyone who holds a license or registration with the State of South Dakota must have the required continuing education hours in order to renew his or her license or registration. If all else fails, wires that attach to the outlet are loose or the outlet itself has failed.</p>

The best way to prevent damage during from lightning storm is to unplug devices that could be irreparably damaged. All installations were done at the designated times. Our electricians can work with any make of surge protection.
