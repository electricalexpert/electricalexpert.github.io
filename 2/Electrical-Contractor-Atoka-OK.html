<p>Because electrician licensing regulations and electrical code often varies from state to state - and even from jurisdiction to jurisdiction within a state - there is no official, universal job description for residential electricians. Both wires and cables use labeling to tell you about the wire size, the material, the number of wires inside a cable, the type of insulation, and other special ratings. Capabilities exist to modernize and extend the life of the active components, i.e., circuit breakers, while leaving the existing switchgear structure intact.</p>
<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected. This is the preferred method of wiring a half-hot switched outlet, because if the power is coming from the switch, it is most likely a lighting circuit that is intended to operate lights, not outlets.</p>
