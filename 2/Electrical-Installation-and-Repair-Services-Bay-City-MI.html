<p>Chemical finishes, such as our classic "Matte Bronze" and "Rusty" have changed the landscape lighting world forever and are the envy of our competitors (who have been trying for years to duplicate our signature finishes). At Arrow Electric, Inc., we can provide you with a whole-house surge protection to insure your home and electronics from unpredictable power surges. There is no problem too big or small and we can handle all electrical panel problems with effectiveness and efficiency.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.

The higher watt bulbs of the 120 volt systems are problematic in the fact that they create unwanted glare and reduces your ability to create subtle landscape lighting effects and much more expensive to operate moreover flexibility low voltage fixtures can be moved to different location easily VS high voltage needs j-boxes & wiring to work.</p>
