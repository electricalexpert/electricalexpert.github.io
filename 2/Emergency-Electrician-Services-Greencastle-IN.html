<p>It covers essential circuits or whole house coverage, and produces clean power for sensitive electronics and appliances. Even a little rain can damage a generator, and you'll end up spending a lot of money to fix it. If you have a standby generator outside the home, you'll want to build a small enclosure around it. If you have a portable generator, which you can move in or out of a garage or some other covered location, you probably just need a cover. Since generators are used in case of emergencies, it's vital that they are installed correctly and are poised to work efficiently.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the cable referred to in this document is two-pronged; i.e., there are two independent wires inside. At All Seasons Air Conditioning & Heating, we offer comprehensive electrical services you can count on to keep your home running at peak efficiency. For all upgrades to electrical switchboard call South East Electrical Services today. Circuit breakers are very easy to reset in the case they are tripped, and they also may be used with a GFCI style breaker for added protection from electrical faults.</p>
