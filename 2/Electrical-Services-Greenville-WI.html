<p>Plus home generators run on propane or natural gas, so there's no refueling. Aging, outdated electrical equipment can be modernized to new technology, dramatically improving its performance and lifetime. In a building whose lights (or other devices) are controlled by a low-voltage system, one or more of these 120VAC electrical circuits will power one or more low voltage transformers that in turn will provide low voltate (24VAC) to operate switches and relays controllilng the building lighting system.</p>
