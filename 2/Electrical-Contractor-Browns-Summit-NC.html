Many older homes use fuse boxes to govern electricity, but upgrading to a circuit breaker panel will make your home more efficient and lessen the chance of an electrical fire. When you choose a whole-home generator, you'll not only be able to keep the lights on, but also run major appliances, like your refrigerator, during an outage.</p>
