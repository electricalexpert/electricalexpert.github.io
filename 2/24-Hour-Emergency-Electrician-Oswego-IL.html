<p>With all the complications involved with electrical services and wiring, emergencies and problems can arise at any given time of day. The gasoline generator is also less fuel efficient compared to diesel generators. Buying a larger generator will consume more fuel to power the same appliances that a smaller generator could. However, since I expect the generators to run flawlessly (when everything else does not) and do not want to rely on external companies to help with servicing and maintenance - these kinds of issues decrease its value in my eyes.</p>
<p>1. Turn off the lights and unplug appliances in the part of the house that has lost power.
