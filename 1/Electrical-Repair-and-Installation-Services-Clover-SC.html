<p>It is also possible that your home is of more recent construction and the switch has a neutral in the box as required by code, but is not connected to anything. The white wire is commonly used as the LINE down to the switch and must be re-indentified with a different color to indicate that. Or you could remove the wires from the switch and tie those two together, bypassing the switch. Refueling-If your generator runs on gas, this step won't apply to you because the gas is sourced from an outside pipe.</p>
<p>This is different from the circuit panel illustration which reflects the long-standing practice of having a common neutral and ground tie block which was grounded at the house as well as at the transformer.

<p>Specifically these are hard wired lights, not merely lamps plugged into outlets. Even if you take all the above electrical safety precautions, it's still a good idea to have the right protection in the case of a fire. Here's what to look for when shopping for a surge protector, and how to use it safely once you bring it home.
