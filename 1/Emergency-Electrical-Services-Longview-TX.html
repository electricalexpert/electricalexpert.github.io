Journeyman License: It requires a 4-year experience one of which can be obtained through an approved training program. It is useless to install solar lighting system that can not be successfully maintained for sustained operation. Most low-voltage cables at some point cross connect with devices that do carry a dangerous electrical current, such as electronic switches, multiplexing equipment and PBX private branch exchange systems,” Janeway said.</p>
<p>Homes that live in areas that are known to frequently get severe weather, like homes near the coast, should have backup power generators installed.
