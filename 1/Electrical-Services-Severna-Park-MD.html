<p>Do note that a power strip is simply an over glorified extension cord while a protector will actually protect your equipment from damage. If you want to have standby backup power for your entire house, you are going to need almost double the largest size to power most homes completely. Due to an ever-increasing requirement for improving energy conservation efforts and the importance that this initiative will have on our future and well-being, it makes sense that by using these lower voltage lights and saving more energy that you can also take part in helping with the conservation goals needed to prevent using up our valuable energy resources or to continue rapidly depleting them.</p>
<p>Instead, call an electrician to repair and replace the malfunctioning breaker. Cords should be firmly plugged into outlets - if the cord is loose and can pull out easily, choose a different, more snug outlet.

It could damage the electrical system in your house or even cause a fire. Sometimes, these outlets can even start small electrical fires.</p>
