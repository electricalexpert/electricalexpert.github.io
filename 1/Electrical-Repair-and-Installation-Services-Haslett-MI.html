Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>

A landscape maintenance contract is the most cost-effective way to maintain your outdoor lighting systems.
