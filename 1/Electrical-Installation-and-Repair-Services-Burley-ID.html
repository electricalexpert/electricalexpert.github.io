<p>Arc-fault circuit interrupters (AFCIs), installed at the service panel, protect against such dangerous shorts and are now required in new bedroom circuits. How to Become One : Most electricians learn through an apprenticeship, but some start out by attending a technical school. It actually sounds like this is the problem; confusion over what color goes where in those wires from the switch. The hot source wire is removed from the receptacle and spliced to the red wire running to the switch.</p>

If you are interested in an electrical service panel upgrade, Dolce Electric Co schedules an in-office electrician Mesa AZ homeowners can consult with free of charge.
