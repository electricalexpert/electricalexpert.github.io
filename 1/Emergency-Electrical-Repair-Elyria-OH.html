In this manner, the power must go from the receptacle box to the switch, through the switch and return to the receptacle box and GFI. Lighting repairs are an important because lighting is a part of the look and feel of a New Castle County home.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel.
