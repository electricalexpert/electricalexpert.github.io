When you call our 24-hour emergency electrical service, you will talk to a licensed electrician who will ask you a few questions about your residential problem and dispatch an emergency electrician as soon as possible. Just answering the question as to whether you need the system to power the entire house or just emergency loads will help you determine the transfer switch size.</p>
<p>Electricity is important to the workings of the home, but can be dangerous, especially to children. Transmission and Distribution Construction services (includes electrical design, development, maintenance and testing services)Transmission lines carry high voltage current from the substation, where the power is produced.
