If you purchase a transformer that doesn't have a photocell light sensor, you will probably be adjusting the on time about every 2 months, remember, I learned this through trial and error, it wasn't a big deal at first, but it seems to wear on me after a few years. Make sure your property is prepared for a power outage by installing a backup generator.</p>
<p>6. It's important to size circuit breakers for the wire size they serve. LED fixtures fond of the open air. Low Voltage Transformers or Transverters are devices used to provide 24VAC power to the low voltage switches & controls in the building.
