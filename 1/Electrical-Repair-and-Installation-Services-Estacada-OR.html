PRECO offers surge protection (PDF) to members to help stop indirect surges that could damage or destroy household wiring and large appliances such as air conditioning and refrigeration equipment. A computer system stands to lose gobs of important data in the 10 to 20 seconds between the time the power goes out and the generator starts pumping electricity.</p>

For example, tt is important to make sure your Air Conditioner doesn't turn on before the generator has had some time to get up and running to full capacity.</p>
