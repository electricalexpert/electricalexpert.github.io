Always use ladders made with non-conductive side rails (e.g., fibreglass) when working with or near electricity or power lines.</p>

When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
