<p>Call Mr. Electric's certified electricians for a free evaluation. That's because the store you were in has a standby generator, also known as a backup generator. You can get generators in a wide range of sizes, the largest being for massive power plants that can be used for ages and generate huge amounts of electricity, to small domesticated ones that can generate enough power to home or business. Inside your house, you have a complex web of electrical wires just like you do veins in your own body.</p>

This poses a safety issue because many old circuit breakers won't trip when they are called upon to. This could be a potential fire hazard as heat builds up possibly breaking down components of your wiring and leading to a fire.</p>
<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess.
