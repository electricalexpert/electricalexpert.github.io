<h3>Benefits of Hiring an Electrical Contractor in Niles OH</h3>
<p>Remove the top black wire and splice it to two 6" jumper wires. Upgrading an existing panel to 200 amps (which is currently a required minimum standard) costs between $850-1,150. A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>As a licensed Air Conditioning & Heating Contractor, Hannabery HVAC provides high quality, professional standby generator installations, standby generator replacements, standby generator repairs, standby generator maintenance, and related services for the greater Lehigh Valley; including Allentown, Bethlehem, Easton, and all of Eastern Pennsylvania. Either portable or stationary, a Generac generator can run on gasoline, diesel, natural gas, oil, or propane.</p>
