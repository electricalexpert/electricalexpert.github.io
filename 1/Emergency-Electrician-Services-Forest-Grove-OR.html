<h3>Tips for Hiring Electrical Maintenance Service in Forest Grove OR</h3>
<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening.

It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one‚Äîyou can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
