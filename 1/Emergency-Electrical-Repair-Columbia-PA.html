<p>From high-capacity electrical requirements to the demanding needs of 5-star resorts, Tri-City has demonstrated a standard of performance that has positioned the company as the state's leading electrical contractor. This might seem like a no-brainer, but you'd be shocked by how many businesses get burned by non-licensed commercial electricians. At IEC, our mission is to provide your apprentices, journeymen and management with education, training and forums so you can build a team of professionals and excel in the electrical construction industry.</p>

<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
