<p>Installing a network line protector directly into a server or a router can prevent further damage from taking out a server. This 8 kW home standby generator can power large appliances, but also produces clean energy suitable for sensitive electronics, during an outage.

<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
