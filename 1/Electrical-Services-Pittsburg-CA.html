The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power. Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>This may even be more expensive than your initial light installation costs. Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them. The electrical panel of your home is considered the control center behind every single electric exchange in the house.
