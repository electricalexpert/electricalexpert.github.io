Don't get caught without power when severe weather rolls through or your electric company experiences a blackout—make sure your business has a working commercial backup generator installed.</p>
<p>Circular saws, drills, power sanders, and other electrically powered tools can deliver nasty shocks or burns Protect yourself by practicing proper electrical safety: Periodically inspect the cords and plugs on all power tools or extension cords, and avoid using any tool if the cord shows signs of fraying, nicks, cuts, cracks, or burns. LED or Halogen Systems: As with everything else in lighting, the market is quickly going to LED. Although tripping is normal, if your electrical panel is tripping all the time, it likely means that you need more power than your current system can provide and that you'll need an upgrade to your home's wiring and electrical panel.</p>
