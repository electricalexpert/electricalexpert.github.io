Fuse boxes are rare today and should be replaced with a modern circuit breaker panel. You can, but there is a good chance that the red wire is the switched one.</p>
<p>Took about 4 days to install - including leveling a 20" grade, building a pad, drilling a brick and 8" thick concrete basement wall, transfer switch installation and gas line installation.

Furthermore, because LED fixtures are smaller, they allow for lighting designs which previously may have been impossible due to the limitations of standard systems.</p>
