An automatic standby generator system monitors incoming voltage from the utility power line supplying a home or building with electricity via automatic transfer switch that is integrated into the structures electrical system.</p>
<p>Licenses that are inactive for a significant time can be revoked entirely by the state, and contractors that perform work under an inactive or revoked license may be subject to penalties.
