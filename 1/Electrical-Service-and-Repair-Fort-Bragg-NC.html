<p>So look for one with at least an Underwriters Lab's rating of "UL1449" and labeled "Transient Voltage Surge Protector". A Champion home standby generator provides peace of mind, security and convenience for your family during an emergency by automatically powering the essentials or your entire home.

While regular and modern appliances need 100-200 amps or more amps of power, fuse boxes are only designed to handle 30-60 amps of power. Electricians in Wyoming must hold a state license to work.</p>
