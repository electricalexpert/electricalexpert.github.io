<p>For your own safety, always unplug a lamp when you change the light bulb. Sometimes, it makes more sense to replace your panel rather than repair it.

Most homeowners call electricians in an emergency or if they're building or remodeling. Portable backup generators range in price from $500 for a 3,250-watt unit to $1,500 for a 10,000-watt unit.</p>
<p>But when it comes to outdoor landscape lighting, 120v has some drawbacks. Finally, get licensed or certified (if required). A common mistake is to get the largest unit available to power the entire house. Many electricians consider old panels that have been manufactured by Zinsco and FPE to be very problematic. This could involve isolating components and evaluating their circuit parameters or isolating the circuits by group when dealing with a complicated circuit.</p>
<p>All backup generators we carry are backed with a guaranteed written warranty for parts and labor.
