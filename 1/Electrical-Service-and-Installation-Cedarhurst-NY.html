We can schedule a consultation or install or repair your lighting as needed per your project requirements. If you've read our long article on electricity , you'll know that an electric current is a flow of electrons (tiny particles inside atoms ) carrying energy through a metal or another substance in a loop called a circuit.</p>
<p>More people die from carbon monoxide poisoning from the gas engines on generators than from the disasters causing the power outages. We provide installation, service and repairs on both indoor and outdoor commercial lights.
