First, only 14 (not 12) gauge wires are to be inserted in the "quick-wire" holes available on the back of many receptacles and switches. I have tried to get several electricians in the past to perform this service for me and either they didn't know how to do it or they quoted an absurd price to avoid the job.</p>
<p>Outdated electrical wiring isn't a repair that you should put off. The biggest advantage of low voltage lighting is it's size.
