<p>When an electrical panel needs to be replaced, upgrading the service should also be considered. Professional generator installation is the best way to avoid this issue. Before you replace the fuse, be sure to turn off all electrical appliances on its circuit, particularly those that you suspect may have caused the fuse to blow. Permanent home standby generators are also considered as automatic systems. This article also covers lighting equipment connected to a Class 2 power source.</p>
