<p>Whether your outdoor lighting is more functional or for aesthetic purposes, our expert team can help install the perfect lighting fixtures for your unique needs. To make your backyard or garden pop this spring and summer, install some low-voltage lighting to illuminate fences, flower beds, and other features. Step 7: Remove the wire nut connecting the two neutral wires in the back of the box and add a third white wire to the mix. Protect your business, home, or family with an affordable power solution from Innovet Electrical & Heating and Cooling.</p>
<p>When designing or wiring landscape lights, it is extremely important not to go over the wattage capability of the transformer, plus by having the extra wattage available, will allow you to add more lighting to your system in the future if you desire. MVP Electric, Heating & Cooling provides professional electrical services in Kansas City, MO and the surrounding areas. Stephen: I can't imagine why a white wire is spliced to two blacks and folded into the box except to provide power to the switch, but also can't see that it would do any harm to add a pigtail to the blacks and terminate it on the unused brass screw now that you have broken the tab off.</p>
<p>Rather than sticking up from the ground, these lights are designed to lay almost flush with the ground. Suspecting a short, I disconnected the white from the "jumper" splice and the switch and ran a separate wire directly from the switch to the jumper splice in its place. Electricians specializing in construction primarily install wiring systems into factories, businesses, and new homes. Landscape lighting is specifically referred to in 406.8(B)(2)(a) for all receptacles located in a wet location.</p>
<p>1. Rewire the house with copper wiring. The transformer converts the 120 volts coming from the household line to a usable 12 volts to operate the lights. Experience: Typical experience for an industrial electrician is the installation of process equipment that requires specific knowledge of the manufacturing industry we are in. Wiring in a food processing plant uses different procedures than wiring in a automotive production facility. When a fuse becomes too hot, a piece of wax melts, and every time that wax melts the fuse needs replacement.</p>
