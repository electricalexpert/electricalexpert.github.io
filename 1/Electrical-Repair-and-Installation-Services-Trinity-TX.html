Home standby generators are designed to perform a test run anywhere from once a week to once a month, depending on the manufacturer, to ensure proper operation.</p>
<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought. For example, tt is important to make sure your Air Conditioner doesn't turn on before the generator has had some time to get up and running to full capacity.</p>
<p>At Superior Heating, Air Conditioning & Electric, Inc., we provide our customers an array of electrical services, including lighting repair and installation. Standby generators allow central Illinois homeowners access to backup power when utility services are out. If you complete all of these tests and there is 12-volt DC power coming to the water pump motor, and it still doesn't come on, chances are the water pump is bad and it will need to be replaced.
