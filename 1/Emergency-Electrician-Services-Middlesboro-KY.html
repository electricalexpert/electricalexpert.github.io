<h3>Scheduling Regular Electrical Maintenance Services in Middlesboro KY</h3>
<p>First things first: A backup generator is an electrical system that allows homes to maintain power on some (or all) appliances during an outage.

Our licensed electricians have the experience and knowledge needed to install smoke detectors and make recommendations so that you and your family can feel protected from possible fire hazards.</p>

<p>Applicants applying for a residential electrician's license must present proof of insurance, and: (1) Have four (4) or more years experience in the practice of electrical construction and obtain certification form a residential contractor license holder that the applicant has the experience and knowledge to qualify for the license sought; or (2) Pass the required examination for the particular license sought.
