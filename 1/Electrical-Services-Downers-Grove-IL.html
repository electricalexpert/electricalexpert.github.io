<h3>Electric Generator Service Centers Downers Grove IL 60516</h3>
<p>Permanent home standby generators - depending on the configuration and model - are mostly built to have an auto-transfer switch that recognizes interruption in the power supply and provides power to home appliances, including air-conditioning systems. Your generator's fuel consumption may increase over time, which is an indicator of broken parks or the system wearing out as a whole. We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
<p>To determine which size transformer you need, simply add up the wattage of all the lights in the system. Or, you can show 8,000 hours of experience from outside the state. Choose the wire that goes to the unswitched half of the outlet or, if the entire outlet is switched and there is an extra black in the box that is not being used you might try that one.
