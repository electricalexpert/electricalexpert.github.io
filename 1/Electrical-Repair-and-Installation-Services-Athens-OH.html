<h3>Tips on Upgrading Your Electrical Panel in Athens OH</h3>
<p>Only the most qualified, professional electricians join the Mr. Electric team. Generator breakdowns can occur at the most inconvenient times, so rely on our certified, skilled technicians to make the repair quickly and correctly the first time. Homeowners hire Mister Sparky electricians to get their residential jobs done right and completed on time. To protect all the wiring in that circuit, a 15-amp circuit breaker is installed. When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>
<p>Wolf electricians have the expertise and experience needed to review your current panel and provide you with the best upgrade plan for your home and requirements. Electrical Contractor License: The Department of Community and Economic Development registration is required. Turn off all electrical appliances when you go out. Despite this many still say the old fashioned long brick design is the best power surge protector that you can find. In this video, we outline the installation of a 16kW Generac air-cooled automatic standby generator and a RTSY-200 automatic transfer switch.</p>
<p>First, connecting the wires leading to downstream outlets with wire connectors creates a more secure connection. Hook the wires onto the new receptacle. We didn't buy a whole-house generator because I didn't want to run out of fuel with an extended power loss. Landscape lighting is also more affordable than ever coming in dozens of styles at a wide range of prices. Schedule with us to provide a safety inspection of your home and call us to perform a full electrical inspection on a home you may be looking to purchase.</p>

If this is the case, connecting a new 100 amp main breaker panel to it will not provide you with 100 amps of available power. The automatic transfer switch sends generator power to your home. Once these screws have been removed, you should be able to grasp the switch or outlet and pull it out of the junction box.</p>
