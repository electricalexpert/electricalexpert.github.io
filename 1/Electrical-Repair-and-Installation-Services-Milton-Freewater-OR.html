With your new switches connected, carefully push everything back into the electrical boxes. Or maybe it's something bad, like a new electrical contractor opened up in your town and hired away some of your best people. Don't run extension cords under the rug or carpet. Electricians train to handle a wide variety of issues with electrical power, lighting and control systems.</p>
<p>When your office's can lights die, or when it's time to replace your home's landscape lighting, you can trust Mr. Electric to tackle the job right the first time.
