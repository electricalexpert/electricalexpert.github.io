<p>When it comes to your Birmingham home's electrical system, there are a number of different components that all work together in order to supply your home with the steady stream of power you have come to expect, and your electrical wiring is a major component within that system. A whole-house surge protector is a device installed to protect all the appliances in your home from any electrical spikes by limiting excess electrical current through blocking its flow or shorting it to the ground.</p>

<p>Home generators run on diesel, gasoline, propane or natural gas. From arriving on-time, to our friendly and expert service, you'll appreciate quality electrical workmanship in a manner that puts your needs first. Transformers in substations near to buildings turn the high voltage power into lower voltages that the appliances in our homes can safely use. Electrical power generation ( to power starter motors and driving) is essentially a chemical process. Whether your home is already struggling to meet your electrical needs or you are thinking about building an addition or renovating, you will likely need to upgrade your panel to allow for additional circuits.</p>
<p>Once the backup generator senses the utility power is back on, your home is automatically transferred to the utility power. One of the best ways to safeguard your work, your refrigerated food and your comfort is with a home backup generator installed by Conductive Electrical Contracting. You should check your house for electrical safety at least once every ten years, or if you have recently moved into a new home. Standby generators use an automatic transfer switch (ATS) that connects your generator to your electrical system.</p>
