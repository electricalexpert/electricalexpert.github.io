Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>One of the six surge-protected outlets is a transformer outlet designed to accommodate larger power adapters. Contact a residential electrician when you want to install, upgrade, or repair the following: home electrical wiring, a new electrical power panel, lighting systems, and major appliances (for example, a Jacuzzi) in your house or condo, which will usually have single-phase electricity. Before your appointment, decide if you want your entire house to have electricity during an outage or if you only want to power specific areas or appliances.</p>

Once you have determined your purpose for buying outdoor lights, you can now choose for the type of lighting fixture. Master Electrician: You need to have at least 5 years of experience, equaling 10,000 hours, in commercial, residential, or industrial work. This type of lighting gives less bright light than mains, but it is often still good enough to light up a path, bedding area, or even useful practical light if there are enough lights and they are near enough to where the light is wanted.</p>
