<p>The popularity of outdoor living has brought a new focus to outdoor lighting. From landscape lighting to area lights and architectural sign lighting. Avoid overloading extension cords, power strips, or outlets. Most breaker boxes are 100, 150 or 200 amps. Trust Graf Electric to professionally upgrade or service any type of commercial indoor lighting. It will also give you the peace of mind that the electrical panel is not the hazard it once was. Then, it might be a good idea to look into a standby generator installation.</p>
<p>Enhance the ambiance and visual appeal of your outdoor space with professional landscape lighting. New construction and home remodeling electrical work. If some of the lights are dim or are out completely, this will definitely hinder the beauty of the landscape lighting. Our residential electricians are fully licensed by state and local jurisdictions, assuring you that your electrical project will be installed to exact industry and code standards. Next step is to disconnect the current from that circuit either by switching off and removing the fuse or by simply switching off the circuit breaker.</p>
<p>Commercial indoor lighting maintenance- Includes regular inspections, fixture cleaning and bulb replacement. There are also voltage testers available that you can place on a wire and it will let you know if electricity is running through it. These are available at any hardware store, and are recommended if you are doing any electrical work. Here are eight things you should know about buying an emergency standby generator.

<p>The 100 amp electrical service in your home is insufficient for operating necessary appliances. Part of the current from the black wire will return through the white wire on the red wire GFCI, causing an imbalance in both GFCI's. This connects to the generator so you can plug in appliances without running (potentially risky) extension cords outdoors. The panel was never designed for this and and for that and several other reasons the local utility usually will not allow it. If they did, then you could add up 200 amps of solar since you would be coming in ahead of the main breaker.</p>
