<p>Installation electricians, or construction electricians, specialize in installing the electrical systems for newly constructed buildings. Factory, Industrial & Warehouse Lighting: The most dramatic and energy efficient results are seen when STG Electric Services replaces or retrofit older High Bay fixtures with new LED lighting technology. The downside is you have to run extension cords everywhere you want power and you're limited to how many things you can plug in at once (most generators have either two or four outlets).</p>
<p>Track lighting is a great, space-saving, versatile, and artistic way to illuminate your home or business. Below are some of the jobs that electrical contractors can provide residential customers.

At times it is more effective to start at the motor and work back to the starter; in other instances it's better to begin at the starter and move towards the motor. Journeyman Electrician - You must complete 2,000 hours of experience and pass an exam.</p>
<p>Natural gas, propane, and diesel are the most common fuel types. Have a qualified electrician add more receptacle outlets in your home to reduce the use of extension cords. These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time. Damaged or Cracked Outlet plate - If your plate surrounding the outlet is damaged significantly, you may have electrical damage or dangerous wiring.
