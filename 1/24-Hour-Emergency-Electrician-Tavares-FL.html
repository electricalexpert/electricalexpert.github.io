<p>Generators are sized according to wattage produced: The more watts, the bigger the unit - and the higher the price tag. Do not use extension cords or multi-outlet converters for appliances. And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors. However, by installing surge protectors where needed, you can protect the multiple pieces of equipment that share a common electric outlet.</p>
<p>The best and the most affordable option are to go for low voltage cable lighting. From the ceiling junction box, the cable splits off, and travels to each of the other boxes in the circuit. Most low-voltage lighting systems include a transformer that is plugged into a regular outdoor electrical outlet. Make sure that gold and silver screws on the old and new switches correspond. Complete the rough-in phase of the wiring job by connecting the appropriate wires with wire connectors, adding short lengths of wire (pigtails) where they're needed and folding all the wires neatly into the boxes.</p>
