When upgrading home electrical wiring or remodeling the actual height can be adjusted so the elevations of the switches and outlets will match other existing outlets and switches. A direct stroke occurs when the lightning hits the power systems directly that the immense potential will cause destruction of the equipment or the facility.</p>
<p>Wolf electricians have the expertise and experience needed to review your current panel and provide you with the best upgrade plan for your home and requirements. Electrical Contractor License: The Department of Community and Economic Development registration is required. Turn off all electrical appliances when you go out.

<p>In order to know the gauge of the wire and the circuit information, you'll have to check the cable-sheath labeling. Watch out: if the "hot" wire in your light switch is on a 3-way circuit you may not always have power at your add-on receptacle.
