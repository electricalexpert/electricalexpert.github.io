These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time. Damaged or Cracked Outlet plate - If your plate surrounding the outlet is damaged significantly, you may have electrical damage or dangerous wiring. Pendant Lighting: We can install hanging lights or pendant lighting in homes with high ceilings.</p>
<p>Typical off the shelf models, called "point of use" protectors are the most common and are designed to safely protect only a few devices at a time. It is better to install both types, external protection, as mentioned above; and point-of-use protection, which is a single surge protector that plugs into an outlet. If you aren't sure of normal circuit wire size, use the #15 ampere Type-S time-delay fuse. A more advanced industrial electrician will be strongly involved in the control wiring and operation of process equipment.</p>
