<p>Electricians should also offer fuseboard upgrades to further enhance the safety of your electrics. The thing about generators is that they still need fuel of some sort to generate electricity, and most of these ones that you will be wanting to get only last a few hours, to a day at most, and really don't put out a lot of power.
