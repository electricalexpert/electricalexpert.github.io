<p>Voltage indicators are useful when checking for breaks in AC wiring. Every safe home wiring system should equal or exceed the requirements of the National Electrical Code. These panels have a main built-in breaker that can shut off all the power to your property. This course introduces Kirchhoff's voltage and current laws and explains how to use these laws to calculate the voltage and current of circuits. Whole house generators work hard and will need maintenance if they're going to be ready to power your home in an emergency.</p>
