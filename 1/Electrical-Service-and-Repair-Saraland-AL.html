We respond quickly with fully licensed and professional staff to fix the problem and always provide up front pricing. Single tap transformers are not usually an issue, except where the transformer primary voltage is excessive and, under a light load, the secondary voltage exceeds the 42.4-volt peak.</p>

Dead outlets with worn or loose connections are useless, two-prong outlets are incompatible with many modern appliances, and flickering lights are distracting.
