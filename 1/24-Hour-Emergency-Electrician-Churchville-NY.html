<p>When an electrical panel needs to be replaced, upgrading the service should also be considered. Professional generator installation is the best way to avoid this issue. Before you replace the fuse, be sure to turn off all electrical appliances on its circuit, particularly those that you suspect may have caused the fuse to blow. Permanent home standby generators are also considered as automatic systems. This article also covers lighting equipment connected to a Class 2 power source.</p>
<p>This type of generator is installed permanently at your home (typically in the yard) and is connected directly to the electrical panel of your home. Our surge protection devices (SPDs) and modules are designed to provide protection from transient overvoltage. Make sure all electrical outlets are three-hole, grounded outlets. Similarly, electrical appliances should never be handled with wet hands as this heightens the chance of getting an electric shock.
