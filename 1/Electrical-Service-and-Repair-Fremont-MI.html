A home standby generator system has two parts: the generator unit and an automatic transfer switch. Typical home electrical cable has a bare ground wire and two insulated wires inside. To offer renewable solar energy systems that replace conventional power generation solutions. Often the low voltage switching relays, low voltage transformer, and on occasion other low voltage building wiring components are collected in one or more control panels such as this Touchplate Low Voltage Wiring control panel shown below - photo courtesy Doug Ford.</p>

Please note: Surge protection equipment will not protect you or your home against a direct lightning strike. Our team can install and repair most types of outlets and switches, and we stand behind our work with a money-back guarantee.</p>
