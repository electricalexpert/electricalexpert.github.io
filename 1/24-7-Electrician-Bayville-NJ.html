We also offer maintenance plans for maintaining your generator, so it's in great working order whenever you need to use it. Once your generator has been installed, our tech will talk to you about which affordable maintenance plan is the right choice for you and your budget.</p>
<p>Usually, a circuit breaker sub panel will service one separate area that has a discrete function, such as a kitchen, shop, office, or addition. And just as before, the neutral wire connects to the silver screw and the ground wire to the green screw. Water conducts electricity much more effectively than solid ground does, which makes that line even more dangerous. The most common type of electrical injury for pets is electrocution from chewing on an electrical cord.</p>

<p>First Indian Power Transmission Company to receive ISO 9001 Certificate. For help with circuit design and making connections to your main electrical panel, we recommend you consult a licensed electrician. As your service panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, it's critical that it's updated to meet today's energy demands and safety requirements. There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>
<p>Master Electrician: Must complete 2,000 hours as a licensed journeyman under a contracting master electrician. If you find yourself using power strips or extension cords in your home, then it's a strong sign that you are using more electricity than your home was designed for. Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Natural gas, propane, and diesel are the most common fuel types. Have a qualified electrician add more receptacle outlets in your home to reduce the use of extension cords. These smaller surges can send little pulses of extra electricity to the devices that are plugged into your home and can damage them over time. Damaged or Cracked Outlet plate - If your plate surrounding the outlet is damaged significantly, you may have electrical damage or dangerous wiring. Pendant Lighting: We can install hanging lights or pendant lighting in homes with high ceilings.</p>
