<p>As homes and businesses require more wiring, electricians will be needed to install the necessary components. The whole lead covering is made electrically continuous and is connected to earth at the point of entry to protect against electrolytic action due to leaking current and to provide safety in case the sheath becomes alive.

<p>Shown in this wiring diagram is the power from the circuit breaker panel going to an electrical receptacle outlet and then continues to the next outlet and then to a single pole wall switch and then to another outlet.
