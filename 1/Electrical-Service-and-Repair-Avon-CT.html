<p>Standby generators don't need to be hooked up every time you need power. By diverting excess pressure in the hose (your home's wires) surge protectors safeguard wiring and appliances. Today's electronics, appliances, lighting and remodeling needs may leave your existing electrical service panel underpowered.
