Some landscape designers can be confusing when discussing angles, colors and placement of the lights. For any extended wiring circuit, always use the same size cable for the continuation.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel.

Because electricians must travel to different worksites, local or long distance commuting is often required. All power outlets should be earthed or grounded to prevent electric shocks.</p>
