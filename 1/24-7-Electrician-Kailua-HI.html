<p>However, you are approaching the age threshold and we would recommend having an annual electrical inspection performed by either a certified home inspector or a licensed electrician. While LEDs are becoming a more popular choice for this kind of project, if you decide to go with traditional halogen lighting then you will to need buy a transformer with a maximum wattage of 20% more than your total wattage. During a power outage you would plugin your portable generator, start it up, and turn the transfer switch to "generator mode." We can install transfer switches that manage your entire home or just your most important circuits.</p>
<p>This may even be more expensive than your initial light installation costs. Because devices plugged into your outlets are designed to work within specific voltage ranges, a power surge can risk damaging or destroying them. The electrical panel of your home is considered the control center behind every single electric exchange in the house. Many home handymen are quite competent when it comes to installing a new or extra electrical outlet (receptacle) or group of light fixtures in their homes.</p>

<p>These can be connected to the wires in the junction box by twisting the uninsulated end of the wire from the switch to the incoming and outgoing wire using wire nuts. Low voltage lighting wire is usable outside only. If you have a pond with an electric pump, take steps to make sure the pump doesn't electrify the water; install it according to the manufacturer's instructions and keep it well-maintained.

A home standby generator system has two parts: the generator unit and an automatic transfer switch. Typical home electrical cable has a bare ground wire and two insulated wires inside. To offer renewable solar energy systems that replace conventional power generation solutions.
