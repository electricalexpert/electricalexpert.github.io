    <meta name="description" content="Affordable Electrician Services Glen Saint Mary Florida - Of the most professional ones, they install with the ground part of the plug up. it looks wierd, bur there is a reason behind it. If something falls between the wall and the plug (like a coin for instance), it will hit the ground first, then slide to either the load side or the neutral side therefor not causing a short between neutral and load which can cause a fire.">

We believe our customer's electrical safety is of the utmost importance and that is why we provide a FREE safety inspection with every service.

<p>3. Whole-House protection - This is what I had mentioned above. While it is true that most people can safely re-wire a plug and there is no need to call an electrician for that one, any tasks more complicated than that, including fitting replacement switches; would be better left to the professional unless you know exactly what you are doing.
