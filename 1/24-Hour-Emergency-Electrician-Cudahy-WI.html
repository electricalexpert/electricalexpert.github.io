These lights are solar-powered and have an integrated light sensor so they turn on automatically at night and off when the sun comes up in the morning.</p>

We'll call you to confirm your time and send you a confirmation email with a picture of your electrician, so you know who to look for. Ask first what are the best outdoor lights before investing.
