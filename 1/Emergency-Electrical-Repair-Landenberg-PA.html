<p>Surge protectors are also called power strips, surge suppressors and transient suppressors. Make sure the electrician is not only licensed but bonded and insured for the job, as well. But at the closer analysis wrong use or fixing of these electrical wiring causes accidents. We're available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week for all your emergency electrical servicing and repairs.
