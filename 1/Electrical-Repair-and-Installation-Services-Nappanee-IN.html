<p>The lights run for a lot longer than traditional incandescent bulbs and are more energy efficient. Too much of a single color becomes visually overwhelming and boring, so electrical switches can provide needed contrast that carries the eye through the room with a unified, designer touch. The generator offers a power capacity of 15,300 watts on natural gas and 17,000 watts on liquid propane. For these reasons, it is imperative that the maintenance electrician, technician or engineer uses a troubleshooting methodology that enables them to isolate the problem in the shortest amount of time.</p>
<p>Typically, new circuit breakers and new feed copper wire are some cases we will also change the meter base to allow the power company to install larger feeder wires. Use 14-gauge cable for lighting systems that total 200 watts or less and 12-gauge cable for systems that are more than 200 watts. A specialized engineering analysis may be needed to provide sufficient protection, especially in situations of high lightning risk. Practicality-wise, if a device is able to handle the usual fluctuations in power supply and current flow, you don't need to hook it up to a surge protector.</p>
