<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations. Make sure to buy a transformer that can handle the lighting load you need it to. A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
<p>Remote control electrical outlets are for homeowners that are interested in taking steps towards having a fully automated smart home. Despite this lengthy life span, building owners are obligated to perform routine maintenance and testing to ensure their egress lighting systems are fully functional when an emergency arises. This will allow the switch or outlet to be mounted flush with the wall which will make it easier to use.
