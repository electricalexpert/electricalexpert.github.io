We'll show you how to wire three-way switches. Run the loose end of one ground wire to the green screw on the switch and run the loose end of the second wire to the green screw on the outlet.

Unfortunately, many Bergen and Hudson County homes still have outdated electrical panels or are in need of replacement for their circuit breakers and electric meters.</p>
