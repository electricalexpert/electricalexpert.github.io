<p>Many people who live in homes built prior to 1980 have an electrical system that is capable of providing power to outlets, but completely inadequate for today's modern appliances and electronics. As our world becomes more technologically advanced, our homes need to be able to keep up with it. While regular and modern appliances need 100-200 amps or more amps of power, fuse boxes are only designed to handle 30-60 amps of power. Electricians in Wyoming must hold a state license to work.</p>
