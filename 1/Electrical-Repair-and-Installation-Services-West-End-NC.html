Each circuit breaker manages the electrical flow to a segment of your house. Residential electricians work with people on a regular basis. TPS TranSafe Enabled - Our patented TranSafe fault current protection circuitry provides peace of mind that your electronic loads are protected and that your electrical system will not go down due to SPD fault control operations.</p>
