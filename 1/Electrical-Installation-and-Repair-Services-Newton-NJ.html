The system was installed a few days later and the technicians (Mark and Kara) did a very thorough and professional installation. Next, unroll the spool of low-voltage electrical cable and lay the cable beside the fixtures. With preventive maintenance, you'll not only save money on future repairs but also protect your family from the dangers of an electrical issue.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, all low-voltage lighting fixtures must be certified by an NRTL to pass inspection. This guarantees that the transition from regular electrical power to a standby generator system will be almost instantaneous. Here are signs you need an electrical panel upgrade. Make sure the cord can handle the electric demands of your equipment. Unplug any cords or extension cords from these outlets and do not use until a qualified electrician has checked the wiring.</p>
