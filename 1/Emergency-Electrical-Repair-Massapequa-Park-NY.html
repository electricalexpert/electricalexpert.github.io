<h3>Consult With an Electrical Contractor in Massapequa Park NY</h3>
<p>Generators are sized according to wattage produced: The more watts, the bigger the unit - and the higher the price tag. Do not use extension cords or multi-outlet converters for appliances. And portable power stations are large batteries that store electricity for when you need it, the only option for someone who lives in an apartment, say, and has no way to safely run a generator outdoors. However, by installing surge protectors where needed, you can protect the multiple pieces of equipment that share a common electric outlet.</p>
<p>Simco Electric, LLC provides installation and repair services for both residential and commercial generators in Duluth & Hermantown, MN. With a portable or stationary generator, you can be sure to have power when you need it most. GFCI's are required in any area with an increased risk of electrical hazards, such as areas where water is present, like bathrooms and laundry rooms.
