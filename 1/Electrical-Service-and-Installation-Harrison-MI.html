<p>There are low-voltage lighting power units that are marked For Use with Submersible Fixtures or Submersible Pumps.‚Äù In this case, a special transformer is used that complies with the requirements in 680.23 for underwater luminaires installed below the normal water level of the pool.

<p>Portable generators can keep you moderately comfortable, especially if you stagger usage and have an alternate heat source like a fireplace or gas logs. In contrast, independent electrical contractors and the junior electricians who work underneath them don't have such regular hours.
