A switch doesn't actually use a neutral wire; it simply takes hot” current from one location and either opens or closes the loop back to the device. Each generator must also be matched to an automatic transfer switch (ATS), which serves as the brains of the standby-power system and tells the generator when to kick on and turn off.</p>
<p>When your office's can lights die, or when it's time to replace your home's landscape lighting, you can trust Mr. Electric to tackle the job right the first time.

Compare whole house generator installation costs from around the web.
