The big distinction is that residential electricians work in buildings that are residences, single-family homes and small apartment buildings. Lighting not only represents the image of your company, but it enhances business and minimizes liability when in peak operating condition. Pros: Portable generators are cheaper to buy and install than home standby models.</p>
