<p>From high-capacity electrical requirements to the demanding needs of 5-star resorts, Tri-City has demonstrated a standard of performance that has positioned the company as the state's leading electrical contractor. This might seem like a no-brainer, but you'd be shocked by how many businesses get burned by non-licensed commercial electricians.

Lighting can be incorporated into your landscape in a variety of ways, but the fun is in creating a unique look that reflects your own personal taste and lifestyle.</p>
<p>If the box already exists, installing a new outlet should be pretty easy and not require new wiring. Installing a new electrical panel in your home will increase your safety and peace of mind knowing that the heart of your electrical system is working properly for you and your home. Since 1996 Erwin Electric has provided homeowners and business owners with trusted full service electrical contractor services. Working in the trade as a unlicensed contractor could cause you a lot of grief and possible legal problems as well.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
