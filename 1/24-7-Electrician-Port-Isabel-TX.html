<p>If you need to buy or replace your point-of-use surge protectors, look for the UL label , or similar independent testing laboratory seal. It is designed for closer placement near the house as you can have it as close as 18 inches from your house which can cut down on the installation cost. Usually the products having a higher number of joules also have an increased clamping voltage, yielding a larger "let-through" voltage for the appliances or electronics that need protecting.</p>
<p>Shown in this wiring diagram is the power from the circuit breaker panel going to an electrical receptacle outlet and then continues to the next outlet and then to a single pole wall switch and then to another outlet. I just wire nutted the Black wires at the switch and used red for the hot to the switch (and then the switched side of the outlet) and black then at first outlet for always hot side. We create quality, long lasting, energy efficient , lighting schemes, and extreme outdoor lighting designs.</p>
<p>Since my new cable only had black and a white (and green ground) wires, I identified the white as hot with black electrical tape.
