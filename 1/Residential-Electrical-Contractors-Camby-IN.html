The transformer is where the power gets converted from line voltage to low voltage and needs to be installed somewhere nearby. In areas where water is present, use outlets with "ground fault interrupters" or GFIs. With the advancement of technology, we put more and more strain on the electrical panel.</p>
<p>And by the way, I think it's ok to repair a damaged wire inside an electrical box by putting heat shrink tubing over it as long as it is only the insulation that is damaged. Owing to all the benefits of affordable voltage LED lights, there's definitely a selection that may match your wants and spending budget. Eco-conscious choices like CFLs (Compact Fluorescent Lightbulbs) and outdoor lights cost more and can run as high as $200 per light.
