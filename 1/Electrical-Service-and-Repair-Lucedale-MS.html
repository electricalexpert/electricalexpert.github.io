The white (neutral) wire connects to the silver screw, or you place it in the back wire hole on the same side of the device as the silver screw. The white wire is the "neutral" wire, which takes any unused electricity and current and sends them back to the breaker panel.</p>
<p>It works by channeling some excess voltage toward the grounding wire of the outlet, resulting to a prevention of too much flow of electricity to our appliances and devices, and at the same time, it does not affect the performance of our devices.

This isn't too surprising, as being an electrician often means crouching, kneeling and bending to reach the electrical installations you're supposed to be working on.
