The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>Test the lights; if they work correctly, bury the cable. Your family's safety is the utmost important factor to consider when deciding on whether or not to upgrade your home's electrical wiring. If an electrical ground is not located in the motor starter overload circuit, the problem has been isolated to the control circuit field wiring. If you've already purchased your standby generator , we can still perform a premium installation for your peace of mind.

It could damage the electrical system in your house or even cause a fire. Sometimes, these outlets can even start small electrical fires.</p>
