Since Georgia is faced with a substantial amount of thunderstorms each year, surge protection is a concern for every Georgia homeowner and consumer. Too few switches, outlets and lights.

<p>After your new generator is installed, worrying about a power outage will be a lot less of an interruption in your life. Once the electricity comes back on, the generator will go back into standby mode and wait for the next time it's needed.

Whether or not a half-hot outlet is for lighting is debatable, but you must still have a neutral in the switch box. Color output from LED lighting is also variable. Light switches tend to have a long lifespan, but you should be aware of the warning signs that your switches should be replaced. Inspect tools, power cords, and electrical fittings for damage or wear before to each use.</p>
