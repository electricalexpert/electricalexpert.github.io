The availability of makes, types and models can be a little intimidating without having a basic understanding of which appliances you want your backup power source to operate effectively. When it comes to electronic devices everyone wants their investments to be protected. According to the NEC , GFCIs are required in bathrooms, kitchens, basements, and garages; and AFCIs are required in many parts of the home and sometimes the entire home, depending on the state you live in.
