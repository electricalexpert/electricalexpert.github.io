<p>Spotlighting: We typically highlight one or two of your property's focal points using spotlighting. The president of the Electrical Safety Foundation International explains two campaigns created to save lives. A good flow of information between the customer and the electrical contractor is critical to keep a construction job on schedule and budget. If you experience blown fuses, flickering lights, or simply have an old breaker in need of service, it's time to let a professional take a look.</p>

Reading blueprints, or technical diagrams of a work site's electrical wiring.

Grounded circuits are safer than ungrounded circuits. Lightning and other high-energy transient voltage surges can be suppressed with pole mounted suppressors by the utility, or with an owner supplied whole house surge protector.</p>
