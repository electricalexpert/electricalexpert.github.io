Each lighting fixture is hardwired, with special attention paid to the concealment of unsightly wires, which are usually buried underground whenever possible. There will be three wires: one black, one white, and a separate ground wire that may be bare copper or is sometimes wrapped in green.</p>
<p>Whether you need new lights for professional purposes or aesthetic reasons, your electrician will have the know-how to get it done. Although a lot of manufactures supply their fixtures with plastic quick connectors”, we recommend that you throw those away, and use silicon filled wire connectors. To stay safe around electricity, you need to understand the dangers, and to take a series of precautions every time you work with electrical equipment. Consumers can use ESFI's In Home Electrical Safety Check and Out-door Electrical Safety Check booklets to conduct an electrical safety audit of their homes.</p>

PLEASE don't use extension cords as a substitute for repairing or installing building wiring. Whether lighting a path or shedding light in a dark corner of a room, low-voltage lights are an inexpensive solution.</p>
