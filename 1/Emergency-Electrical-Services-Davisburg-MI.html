<p>Because there's little risk of electric shock, Hart says he likes to turn the lights on while installing low-voltage systems. To keep appliances safe, research the wattage requirements and electrical loads before powering them up through a generator. To do this, you will need to briefly touch together specific pairs of the wires: touch the common wire (typically white or yellow) to the ON wire (typically red) to turn the light ON. Next touch the common wire to the OFF wire (typically black) to turn the light OFF.</p>
<p>Output Volt-Amps (VA) is a measurement of electrical power and is used to size a UPS system for the equipment that will be connected to it. Plus, bigger boxes just make wiring easier, especially if they're crammed full of wires and connectors.
