<p>It is dangerous to work on an open electrical service panel with both the door and the protective front cover removed. The ceramic is designed to protect the plug (or other equipment inside which the fuse is fitted) from heat and fire when a high current flows. Another reason you may want to upgrade is if you find yourself constantly needing breaker panel repairs. A circuit is comprised of multiple outlets connected to a single wire that is operated by one fuse or circuit breaker.</p>

<h3>Make Your Property Lightning Proof With Decatur GA Lightning Protection</h3>
<p>First Indian Power Transmission Company to receive ISO 9001 Certificate. For help with circuit design and making connections to your main electrical panel, we recommend you consult a licensed electrician. As your service panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, it's critical that it's updated to meet today's energy demands and safety requirements. There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>
<p>By purchasing the proper outlet surge protector you are taking a preventive measure that can save you thousands, not only in terms of equipment but in data as well. It's not a huge deal if you mix them up, as it will simply switch to the bottom receptacle being the switched one—you can always switch them back. Be careful not to dislodge any wires from the switch terminals - the wires should still be firmly attached to the screws on the switch holding them in place.</p>
<p>A lightning bolt that directly strikes a power line in the vicinity of your home can easily over-power even the best consumer-grade surge protectors. This is perhaps not a project which you should do without help from an electrician, but if you have a permit, you can upgrade your power panel on your own. All the electrical circuits in your home are rated to handle a certain amount of electrical flow (amps). The detached service panel, screwdrivers, wire cutters, wire strippers, pliers, and more are items that can potentially touch parts of the service wires and transmit an electric shock to you.</p>
<p>Instead, call an electrician to repair and replace the malfunctioning breaker. Cords should be firmly plugged into outlets - if the cord is loose and can pull out easily, choose a different, more snug outlet. Your home's electrical breaker box is considered the brains of your home's electrical system. This minimal increase in cost buys a significant increase in electrical safety for children. It could damage the electrical system in your house or even cause a fire. Sometimes, these outlets can even start small electrical fires.</p>
