<p>Commercial electrical contractors don't often like taking residential rewiring jobs and often charge a premium to do so. The circuits in many older electrical systems don't trip, even when overloaded, which poses a great risk to your home.

The system has been integrated with all essential modules from sub-contractors to materials, outsourcing jobs and from plant management to mobile assets and labour.</p>
