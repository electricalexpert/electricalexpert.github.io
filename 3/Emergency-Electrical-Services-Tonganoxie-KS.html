Beginning October 1, 2017, all examinations for state electrical licenses will be based on the 2017 NEC. It's a thin piece of wire designed to carry a limited electrical current. There are different types of electrical lights as well as different types of power sources, such generators, to power important equipment if the power does go out.</p>
