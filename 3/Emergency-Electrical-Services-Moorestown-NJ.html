Cords and plugs that show signs of wear or damage need to be replaced. You need to understand that if you decide to install electrical wire you're indeed playing with fire. Consult an electrician, if necessary, to determine the exact size of circuit wiring to be sure that all circuits are properly protected against overloads.</p>
