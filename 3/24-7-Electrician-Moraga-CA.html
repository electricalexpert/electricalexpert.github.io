<p>In a challenging global economy that demands cost-effective mass production on a timely basis, stopping production due to equipment failure can have major setbacks. The Basic Electrical Wiring Certificate provides fundamental knowledge of electrical wiring and AC and DC circuits. To keep pace with today's fast-growing, innovative business climate, we strive to remain on the cutting edge of electrical installations by using the latest technology.
