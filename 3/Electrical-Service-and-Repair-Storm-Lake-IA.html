<p>CREATING THIS EFFECT: Path lights are staggered around the walkway to create pools of light that illuminate a safe passage to the home's entrance. Reading blueprints, or technical diagrams of a work site's electrical wiring. Walk into any home center or garden center this spring and you're guaranteed to run into a towering display of outdoor low voltage lighting. If the contacts close and open as they should, then the proper voltages will be applied or disconnected from the coils.</p>
