<p>Open and tag the power supply circuit for the outlet being replaced. Any outlet near water should be switched to code-correct GFCI outlets. Generac automatic home backup generators are permanently installed.

When you have a power outage, the generator automatically detects the problem and starts to provide backup power.</p>
