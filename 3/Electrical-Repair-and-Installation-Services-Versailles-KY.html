In order to understand which generator transfer switch is best for your installation, it's recommended to speak with a generator specialist.

Even if you turn off power, electrical wiring can be tricky and is best left to the professionals. The TLC folks promptly responded and scheduled a time to repair or replace right away.</p>
<p>A good electrician will be able to install a quality home surge protector into your panel. Its size makes it perfect for small and medium-sized homes and it monitors when it's close to overloading so it can stop power supply to unimportant circuits to keep the vital appliances running.
