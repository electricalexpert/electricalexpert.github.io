The simplest and most common light switch is actually referred to by hardware dealers and electricians as a single-pole light switch.‚Äù With a single-pole light switch, flipping the lever up completes the circuit, turning lights or appliances on, and flipping it down breaks the circuit, turning lights or receptacles off.
