<p>Enhance the ambiance and visual appeal of your outdoor space with professional landscape lighting. New construction and home remodeling electrical work. If some of the lights are dim or are out completely, this will definitely hinder the beauty of the landscape lighting.

Next step is to disconnect the current from that circuit either by switching off and removing the fuse or by simply switching off the circuit breaker.</p>

Remove the old lighting fixture, and make a physical note on paper detailing what wire goes where.
