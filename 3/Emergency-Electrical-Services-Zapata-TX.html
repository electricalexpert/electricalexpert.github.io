<p>Circuit breakers can be tripped many times without requiring replacement. Licensure and certification requirements vary by state, but typically include passing an exam that covers the National Electric Code, as well as state building codes and regulations.

A transformer will be rated at a certain wattage; make sure that the wattage of your transformer exceeds the sum of the wattages of all your lights.</p>
