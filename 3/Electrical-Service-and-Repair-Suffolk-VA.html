<p>We are committed to providing superior residential electrical services throughout the region. The key difference between a fuse and a circuit breaker is that fuses are single-use. Journeyman License: It requires a 4-year experience one of which can be obtained through an approved training program. It is useless to install solar lighting system that can not be successfully maintained for sustained operation. Most low-voltage cables at some point cross connect with devices that do carry a dangerous electrical current, such as electronic switches, multiplexing equipment and PBX private branch exchange systems,” Janeway said.</p>
<p>One of the black wires receives power from the service panel; the other sends it on to other loads on the circuit. If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks.

When you invest in a whole home generator, you are protecting your home against power surges and blackouts that would otherwise leave you powerless. Another common belief is that if an individual circuit breaker pops or a fuse blows on a regular basis, the service requires upgrading.</p>
