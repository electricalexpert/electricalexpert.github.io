If you are noticing things like warm outlets or seeing signs of a wiring problem, you may need to quickly turn off your home's electricity. It's also important to note that kitchens should always be wired with ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) outlets to prevent accidental electric shocks. We service both new construction and existing structures needing electrical repair or being remodeled.</p>

Jameson electrical technicians will safely repair or upgrade your home's electric main service panel.
