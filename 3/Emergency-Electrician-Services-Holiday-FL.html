<p>These landscape lighting fixtures are designed to safely illuminate stairways and walkways. If you smell something fishy (literally), it could be a burning electrical outlet, switch, or other device. The neutral wire in the new switch box is capped with a wire nut unless it's needed for a smart switch or timer.

I just wire nutted the Black wires at the switch and used red for the hot to the switch (and then the switched side of the outlet) and black then at first outlet for always hot side. We create quality, long lasting, energy efficient , lighting schemes, and extreme outdoor lighting designs.</p>
<p>In addition, electrical panel upgrade can help in reducing your homeowner's insurance bill. Area electrical board members determine percentage requirements. Another level of safety for your home's electrical system is having a grounded wire and grounded outlets. As you might expect, your generator's power output must match your home's electrical requirements. We understand that electrical issues are not only a major inconvenience but can also be potential fire hazards.</p>
<p>Tip: If for some reason you cannot finish connecting the switch or outlet and have to complete it at another time, you can place wire nuts over the ends of the unconnected wires and turn the electricity back on until you have the time to finish the job. Consider having a qualified electrician add more circuits or outlets so you do not have to use extension cords. If you find that your circuits trip regularly, your lights flicker infuriatingly often and the need to unplug the fridge to make your hairdryer work is beginning to get on your nerves, it's time to upgrade your panels.</p>
