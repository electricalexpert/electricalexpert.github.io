Often gardeners, homeowners or landscape maintenance personnel accidentally knock the fixtures out of place as they go about their gardening business, bury the fixtures with mulch or debris, blow leaves on top of the fixtures or otherwise compromise the perfect aiming of the light beams onto their intended subjects. Once the charging system is installed, consumers should take safety precautions such as never using an extension cord to charge the vehicle and regularly inspecting cords and plugs for damage.</p>
