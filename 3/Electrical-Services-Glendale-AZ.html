<h3>Importance of Using a Glendale AZ Licensed Electrician</h3>
<p>A general rule is that you need 3-5 watts per square foot for essential electricity and 6-14 watts per square foot for whole-house electricity based on the number of appliances you have with high electrical demand. With smart light switches, you can ease the strain on your eyes by slowly bringing up the lights. This helps protect the equipment and can help prevent electric shock. Under Australian law, electrical work that involves fixed wiring is strictly regulated and must almost always be performed by a licensed electrician or electrical contractor.</p>
<p>Electrical panels are sized in amperes (amps), a unit that measures the flow of electrical current. Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights. Master Electrician - You must have 2,000 hours of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician under the supervision of a contracting master electrician.
