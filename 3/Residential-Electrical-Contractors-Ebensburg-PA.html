<p>Took about 4 days to install - including leveling a 20" grade, building a pad, drilling a brick and 8" thick concrete basement wall, transfer switch installation and gas line installation. While an electrical panel can last for as much as 50 years or more, it's generally considered safe practice to replace it every 25 years. First remove or repair any loose electrical lines.
