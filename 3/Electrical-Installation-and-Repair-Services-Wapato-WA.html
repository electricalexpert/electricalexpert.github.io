There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>
<p>Never use them with extension cords. Choosing the right emergency electrician can be a very difficult decision to make especially if you are facing a stressful situation.

We partner with Kohler backup generators, bringing you an efficient and reliable source of power, perfectly sized to your requirements.</p>
