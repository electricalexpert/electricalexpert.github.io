<p>RomexÂ® cable is a cable with more than one THHN wire and a bare copper ground. Here we describe replacement switches or relays that can be used to repair older low-voltage switching systems in buildings or to install new low-voltage control systems to switch lights, receptacles, motors. When we answer your call we will make a preliminary assessment of your emergency electrical service needs and give you possible solutions. Whether you are replacing your light fixtures for design purposes or improved functionality, the experts at Korte Does It All, Inc.</p>

Go to a supply house and buy large transformers and quality metal fixtures, not the plastic junk normally asociated with low voltage.</p>
