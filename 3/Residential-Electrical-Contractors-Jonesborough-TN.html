<h3>Remodeling Electrical Contractor in Jonesborough TN</h3>
<p>If the same thing occurred with a three-pronged outlet and you plugged something (with three prongs) into the outlet, the ground wire would absorb the shock and take the current into the ground where it can be safely neutralized. You have now installed a new electrical outlet and can take advantage of the safety and convenience of relocating your power needs. Circuit breakers keep tripping: This is an indication your electrical panel may be wearing down and should be replaced.</p>

We strive to meet your lighting needs and can help you create the perfect scheme that enhances your yard while ensuring the lighting does not become an eyesore.</p>

This type of electrical panel has fuses that burn out, then need replacement. With our thorough electrical safety inspections , we'll be able to identify any problems or issues your system may have and repair them properly. At this point, use a voltage tester to see if the power is truly off to the light switch before you go any further.</p>
<p>In these systems light switches control lighting contactors , a relay that allows the manual light switch to operate on a lower voltage or with smaller wiring than would be required in the main lighting circuit.
