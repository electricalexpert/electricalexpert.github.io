There is no point in time at which the light source ceases to function; instead, LEDs gradually degrade in performance over time. If you want to add more lights, you may need a bigger transformer; if so, it's probably more economical to buy a whole new system in a kit.</p>
<p>Some panels may also be in, immediate need for upgrade due to the safety hazards that may arise as they age. I know, this is highly fascinating but do not tear your electrical devices to see the wiring or your residential power supply because it can be life threatening.
