<p>This type of electrical box has fuses that burn out when they become too hot. Also, it has a higher price tag than a gasoline generator costing between $1,900 and $5,000. This system provides control over all the generator's functions, including automatic transfer switch control, start and stop features, weekly testing and exercise functions, and utility monitoring. Low voltage outdoor lights are also less likely to cause hazardous electrical sparks or currents.</p>
<p>With electrical projects such as lighting fixture installation and repairs, there is a risk for shorting out, electrocution and even fire. Our commercial and residential services include air conditioner repair, refrigeration repair, and fire alarm installation to name a few. Almost everything we do in our homes depends on electricity, from cooking meals to charging our phones and laptops, which is why Swick Home Services has a quality solution for you.
