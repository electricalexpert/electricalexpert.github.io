<p>Illuminate the night with amazing, stylish and affordable landscape lighting. Our experienced project managers and electricians know how important installing the correct lighting is to the success of your commercial space. After installation, our generators are tested and ready to go. Best of all, low-voltage deck light systems don't require you to take the precautions necessary with household 120-volt systems because they are not powerful enough to give you a serious shock.</p>
<p>Down conductors, providing the most direct path possible to move the electrical energy towards the ground. Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights. Look for kits that include lights, 100' of low-voltage cable, and a transformer for lowering current flow. Connect the light by clamping the wires to the power cable.
