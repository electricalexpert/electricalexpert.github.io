Electronics must be protected from inside the home and because each member's needs will be a little different, it is the member's responsibility to purchase point of use” devices. Older controllers use two overloads, while newer units are required to have three overloads in accordance with changes in the National Electrical Code®.</p>
<p>If you have an older home with an electrical system that hasn't been updated, it's a good idea to schedule a general inspection to assess the overall condition of your home's wiring and circuits. In the U.S., electrical contracting is an industry valued at over $171 billion annually, made up of over 70,000 electrical contracting firms employing over 650,000 electrical workers. If your certificate is more than 90 days past the expiration date, you must reapply and take the master electrical examination to reinstate your certificate.</p>
