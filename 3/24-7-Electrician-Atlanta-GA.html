When you're sure the breaker is off, remove the cover plate and unscrew the switch. A plan will insure that you buy the correct amount of materials and fixtures, so don't avoid this one (unless you are only going to be installing one post light and even then you want to know how much wire to buy).</p>
<p>And by the way, I think it's ok to repair a damaged wire inside an electrical box by putting heat shrink tubing over it as long as it is only the insulation that is damaged.

Secure the old-work box to the drywall with screws, wire and mount your new light switch into the old work box, and then secure it to the wall with screws.</p>
