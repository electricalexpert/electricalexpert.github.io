<p>When an electrical panel needs to be replaced, upgrading the service should also be considered. Professional generator installation is the best way to avoid this issue.

Permanent home standby generators are also considered as automatic systems. This article also covers lighting equipment connected to a Class 2 power source.</p>

Properly qualified electricians will happily provide the evidence to assure you of their accreditation and insurance. Based on the severity of the problem, our electrician will give you upfront pricing on the cost to repair or replace your panel. Whole-home surge protectors are installed at your circuit breaker, and they prevent power surges from reaching your electronic equipment.</p>
