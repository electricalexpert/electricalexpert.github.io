This change will alter the wiring coming into your home, meaning that the replacement breakers will not match the existing fuse sizes. Where a stationary generator would be required are situations where power must be restored immediately should an outage occur.</p>
<p>In the most basic of terms, when a home backup generator system senses a power outage it will make the automatic transfer in a matter of seconds to ensure that all electrical circuits are powered normally. From 2003 - 2007, 53% of electrical failure home fires involved other known types of equipment. The constant plugging and unplugging of appliances into outlets and turning lights on and off cause wear and tear over time. We'll take care of your fuse box or malfunctioning electrical panel as fast as we can without sacrificing your family's safety.</p>
