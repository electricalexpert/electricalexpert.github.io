Generator breakdowns can occur at the most inconvenient times, so rely on our certified, skilled technicians to make the repair quickly and correctly the first time. Homeowners hire Mister Sparky electricians to get their residential jobs done right and completed on time. To protect all the wiring in that circuit, a 15-amp circuit breaker is installed. When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>
<p>Two prong receptacles need to be replaced with GFCI outlets and labled with a "No Equipment Ground" sticker that is found in the box with the GFCI receptacle. Low voltage landscape lights would normally be used to illuminate the surroundings of outdoor fireplaces, inducing a certain sense of warmth.

Shown: Underlit trees and accent lights aimed at the facade create an inviting post-sunset atmosphere around this home. Now that you're convinced you should invest in landscape lighting, let Hiller Electrical help you with the specifics.</p>
<p>If your home has an electric panel that is more than a generation old, it could be time for an upgrade. The position of the contacts can be verified by visual inspection or by removing power from the system, ('''CAUTION''': Circuit must be locked, tagged, and tried) lifting the leads to the temperature contacts, and using an ohmmeter to verify that the contacts are closed. You can avoid overloading your generator with surges by turning on connected appliances one at a time.</p>
