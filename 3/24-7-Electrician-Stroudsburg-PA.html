<h3>Solar Panel Installation in Stroudsburg PA</h3>
<p>Only the most qualified, professional electricians join the Mr. Electric team. Generator breakdowns can occur at the most inconvenient times, so rely on our certified, skilled technicians to make the repair quickly and correctly the first time. Homeowners hire Mister Sparky electricians to get their residential jobs done right and completed on time. To protect all the wiring in that circuit, a 15-amp circuit breaker is installed. When the power supply from your utility company shuts down, your standby home generator kicks in within seconds to keep its assigned appliances operating normally.</p>

Buying a portable generator from your local home improvement store and plugging it in may provide some relief, but the only guaranteed way to get the service you need when you need it, is to have your generator professionally installed and maintained by an experienced and reputable service provider. Updated breakers and wiring in your panel will ensure that your home's power needs are met properly and safely.</p>

<p>Issues typically present themselves in a variety of ways, including regular popping of breakers, electrical outlets that only work occasionally, and breaker panels that are a discombobulated mess. While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts. Since we started, First Choice Electrical LLC's number one goal has always been to provide superior customer service to residential clients.</p>
