<p>Whether or not you need to add wiring: If you install a light where no wiring exists, the overall cost of the installation project will increase. The test is pretty easy (I mean electricians need to pass this) and costs about $50. First, only 14 (not 12) gauge wires are to be inserted in the "quick-wire" holes available on the back of many receptacles and switches.

Cords and plugs that show signs of wear or damage need to be replaced. You need to understand that if you decide to install electrical wire you're indeed playing with fire. Consult an electrician, if necessary, to determine the exact size of circuit wiring to be sure that all circuits are properly protected against overloads.</p>
<p>He will also add new circuits for the new appliances or the addition. Here is what you would have to do if possible, change out the 2-wire to 3-wire cable from switch to light.
