<p>If you're considering opening an office, here are some basic electrical tips and considerations, along with recommendations on when you may need to hire a licensed electrician handle this job. A common practice is to wrap switch terminals with electrical tape once their wires are connected.

If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere.
