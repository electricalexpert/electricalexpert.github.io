<p>Ground faults occur when electricity escapes bare, damaged, wet, or poorly insulated wires and takes a shortcut to the ground. A licensed Electrical Contractor shall utilize the appropriately licensed or registered individuals to construct, install, repair or maintain electrical wiring. A landscape maintenance contract is the most cost-effective way to maintain your outdoor lighting systems.

<p>We will help you to decide on whether you should have your outdated fuse panel replaced with a modern Circuit Breaker panel. While they are very different to the typical home consumer, a fuse box serves the same role of a circuit breaker in a building: to prevent the overloading of circuits by cutting off the flow of power and reducing risk of fire.
