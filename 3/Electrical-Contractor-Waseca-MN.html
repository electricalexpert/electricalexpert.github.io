<p>If your transformer low voltage side feeds ( hooks up to ) a relay, then you'd take the farthest lights away from that relay and hook them up BACK to that same relay where the circuit takes off to feed the first lights.

When you turn the switch off, it interrupts the electricity that flows through the black wire from the power source to the fixture.
