<p>A common misconception many homeowners have is that they can protect their home from dangerous lightning strikes and voltage surges simply by plugging their TV or computer into a power strip or just installing a surge protective panel. Grounded circuits are safer than ungrounded circuits. Lightning and other high-energy transient voltage surges can be suppressed with pole mounted suppressors by the utility, or with an owner supplied whole house surge protector.</p>
<p>Secondly, the sub panel provides a sense of clarity and separation of service from the main electrical panel. Laying the Cable: Start by laying the light fixtures on the ground where you intend to install them. The low-priced power strip models of protectors' offer minimal or worse, no protection. These circuit breakers protect every device in the house with sensitive circuitry that responds quickly if there is a fault, opening the circuit and eliminating the risk of danger.</p>
