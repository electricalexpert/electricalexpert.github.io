A surge protector should have protections from overheating, but if you ever feel that it's hot to the touch, replace it. See Three-wire to Touch-Plate® Wiring Diagram available from Touch-Plate Lighting.</p>

Over time, due to settling of your building, dust, humidity, chemicals, or other atmospheric conditions, the wires connecting the breakers and circuits of your electrical panel can become loose and corroded. Needless to say this is much more than you will probably need for most of your home outdoor lighting projects.</p>
<p>Coho Lighting is a licensed Wisconsin electrical contractor specializing in LED parking lot lighting installation and repair throughout Southeastern Wisconsin.
