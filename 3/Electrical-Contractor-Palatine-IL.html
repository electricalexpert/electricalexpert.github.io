<p>I have not tried the drilling machine trick yet, but will doing so most likely before the weekend - I can say that this trick sounds totally logical and correct as when I was still at school and studied Electrical Technology and Auto Electrical principals, we were taught to use a battery, but as I don't have a low current battery ( torch batteries ) on hand without going to buy them specifically for this one time use ( our school always had 6 Volt or 9 Volt lantern batteries on hand for the hands-on class ( referring back to the early 1980's ), I cannot use a standard car battery as the amount of amps the car battery can supply through the low resistance stator coils will burn the stator of rotor coils out instantly.</p>

<p>Perhaps you've rearranged your furniture and realized that you need more lighting in a certain area of a room, or you may need more lights in a naturally dark space like a garage or basement. Surge protectors prevent that from happening. To use a portable generator without the hassle of running extension cords, hire an electrician to install a manual transfer switch subpanel off your main circuit panel and install a dedicated inlet to power the subpanel (installing the subpanel is complex; not a DIY project).</p>

Next step is to disconnect the current from that circuit either by switching off and removing the fuse or by simply switching off the circuit breaker.</p>
