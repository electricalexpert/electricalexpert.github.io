<p>Call Mr. Electric's certified electricians for a free evaluation. That's because the store you were in has a standby generator, also known as a backup generator. You can get generators in a wide range of sizes, the largest being for massive power plants that can be used for ages and generate huge amounts of electricity, to small domesticated ones that can generate enough power to home or business.
