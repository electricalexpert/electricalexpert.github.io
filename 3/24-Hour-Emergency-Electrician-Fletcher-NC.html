Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>

Keep the joined white wires separated from the wires off of the switch. Install safety caps and covers over all outlets to keep your kids safe.
