Make sure to shut off the circuit breaker for the outdoor outlet before wiring the low voltage lights. Look for kits that include lights, 100' of low-voltage cable, and a transformer for lowering current flow. Connect the light by clamping the wires to the power cable.

<p>Test each light fixture for its voltage level with a digital voltage meter (about $25 at Radio Shack). The black wires in the cables are used for connecting switches. Always practice electrical safety when performing any home repairs, and never attempt an electrical repair if you have any doubts about your knowledge or abilities. This indicates there are 4 cables and that one of the black wires is not connected. A no voltage reading locates the trouble in the control circuit; the OL2 is faulty.</p>
<p>This practice will lead to ungrounded outlets that someone may not realize are ungrounded or worse bootleg grounds. A GFI is a light duty electrical plug used in bathrooms, kitchens and the exterior of your house. If you decide that you do not like the way that they look when you are finished, you can always rearrange them because that definitely is one of the advantages of cable track lighting.
