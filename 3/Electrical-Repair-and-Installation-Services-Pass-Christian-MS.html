The transformer can be installed on the side of the house, in a basement or garage or on a post outside.</p>
<p>If you notice a burning smell or see any burn marks near circuit breakers, there is a good chance there was a small fire. Landscape design and lighting is no exception to this. When wiring landscape lights, determining voltage drop is very important so you don't have dim lights at the end of your run. Most of the time, you don't think much about your breaker panel. Water - Before using an extension cord outside or in a wet area, confirm that the cord is rated for outdoor use and make sure the cord is connected to a Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere. You will need to find an existing contractor who is a licensed electrician to train you for a few years, keeping the necessary logbooks to submit for your application to take the electrical licensing examination.</p>
