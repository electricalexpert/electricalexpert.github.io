<p>First Indian Power Transmission Company to receive ISO 9001 Certificate. For help with circuit design and making connections to your main electrical panel, we recommend you consult a licensed electrician. As your service panel is the heart of your home's electrical system, it's critical that it's updated to meet today's energy demands and safety requirements. There are just too many horror stories about electrical projects going wrong with unlicensed and uninsured electricians, even when these contractors came personally recommended.</p>

Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights. Master Electrician - You must have 2,000 hours of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician under the supervision of a contracting master electrician. At least 6,000 hours of this experience must be considered commercial or industrial.</p>
<p>Report any broken poles or trees on the power line or any downed electric lines to NOVEC or the police immediately. The journeyman electrician exam will determine whether or not electrician training has been fruitful. If your house still contains a fuse panel, you should upgrade to a standard breaker panel. Restricted Electrical Licences (RELs) are issued to persons other than electricians to legally carry out a "restricted" range of electrical tasks. If your home is older, it may have a fused-based electrical system.</p>
<p>VPC Electric is personal, professional, and proven in providing emergency electrical services.
