The rest of the system is designed to safely convey that electrical energy from the lighting strike to ground as efficiently and safely as possible. Standby home generators are permanent.

Individual cables can exit the tray at any point, simplifying the wiring installation and reducing the labour cost for installing new cables.</p>
