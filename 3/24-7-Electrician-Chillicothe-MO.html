<p>Redhawk's electrical panel upgrades will bring your old breaker box up to date. In the dark of the evening, an area that is surrounded by landscape lights becomes a room of its own, no matter what the surroundings. The red wire from the switch loop is connected directly to the hot terminal on the outlet. Voltage decreases as it moves through a run of wire and a series of lights. Our team of certified and fully insured electrical experts are available at any time to help repair an issue with your electrical system at home or at work.</p>
<p>The white wires allow current passing through the outlet and the other loads on the circuit to return to the panel. Your home backup generator will simply cycle on automatically when the power cuts out, and will continue powering essential circuits in your home to keep you safe and comfortable for the duration of the power outage.
