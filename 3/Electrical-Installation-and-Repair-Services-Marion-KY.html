<h2>Electrical Panel Repair & Replacement  in Marion Kentucky</h2>
<p>Changing an electrical service panel isn't like changing a fuse or wiring a new ceiling fan. An electrical surge is an unexpected and uncontrolled spike in voltage on an electrical circuit. Recessed lights are installed so that the fixture is unseen. If you are like most people, you are probably aware of some basic electrical knowledge, such as knowing how to flip a breaker and that water and electricity don't mix, but there's also a lot you probably don't know.</p>
<p>If the breakers in your older home trip often, it could mean that your modern appliances are too powerful for the electrical system, or there's faulty wiring. If there are two brass screws for the black wire, and a breakable tab between them, it might be possible. Your final step is to turn on the transformer to ensure that the lights work. If you are the type to use many electronics in your home then you are aware of the energy needed to run all that equipment and the inconvenience of having to unplug all of them when they are not being used.</p>
