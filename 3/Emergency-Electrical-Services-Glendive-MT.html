The difference between 2-prong and 3-pronged outlets is that the 3-pronged outlet has a ground.” Upgrading takes a little more work than just switching the outlet panel. If the lights dim whenever you use a particular outlet, you may be overloading the circuits or wiring. A licensed electrical contractor that is regularly employed by the school system and acting as an employee rather than a contractor while performing regular duties for the school system is not subjected to the examination process and shall be certified as a school maintenance electrician by the NC Department of Insurance upon properly executing and submitting the application for approval.</p>
<p>If you hear crackling, sizzling, or buzzing noises coming from outlets, switches, or appliances , you could have a serious problem.

Electricians will plan the lighting installation with you and complete any installation and testing required.

Limit your choices to those devices that are truly essential during a power outage and you'll keep your total costs down.</p>
