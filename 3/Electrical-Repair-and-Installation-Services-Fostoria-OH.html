Buy a 'single-pole' switch if one switch controls the lights or a 'three-way' if you have two switches controlling the same lights. Master Electrician - You must have 2,000 hours of experience working as a licensed journeyman electrician under the supervision of a contracting master electrician. At least 6,000 hours of this experience must be considered commercial or industrial.</p>
<p>Never plug one surge protector into another surge protector or power strip. The lights have clamps with metal teeth that pierce the cable insulation and tap directly into the power line. If at the switch, you have power between black and ground but none between black and neutral the most probable answer is a disconnected white neutral somewhere.
