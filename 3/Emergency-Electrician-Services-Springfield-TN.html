Most generators run on natural gas so they are able to keep working during a power outage.</p>

<p>Employ only a certified electrician with training and experience in safety practices and procedures, as well as the proper equipment, to perform all major electrical installation or repair. The whole fixture is used as a heat sink for the LED to ensure it continues lighting for years to come. The electrical panel is an important and foundational part of your electrical system.
