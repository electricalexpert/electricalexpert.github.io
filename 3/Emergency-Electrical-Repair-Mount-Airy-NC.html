Our surge protection can help preserve life-saving medical equipment, important data, invaluable electrical systems, and more.</p>

The starter will remain closed if a fuse blows on one phase leg that isn't used for the control circuit, and the motor will run as a single-phase motor.</p>
<p>Whether you need new lights for professional purposes or aesthetic reasons, your electrician will have the know-how to get it done. Although a lot of manufactures supply their fixtures with plastic quick connectorsโ, we recommend that you throw those away, and use silicon filled wire connectors.

While the contacts are separating, any electrical energy stored in the inductance of the circuit being disconnected is dissipated as an arc within the switch, prolonging the transition and worsening the heating effect on the contacts. Since we started, First Choice Electrical LLC's number one goal has always been to provide superior customer service to residential clients.</p>
