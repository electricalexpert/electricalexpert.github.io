The entire fixture is constructed of 100% brass with a removable mounting bracket increasing its uses for small, hard to light spots such as under railings or up-lighting rafters. The outlet has 2 white wires, 2 red wires and 2 black wires attached. These homeowners often don't notice the many advantages of proper lighting until the lights become dim or go out entirely.</p>
