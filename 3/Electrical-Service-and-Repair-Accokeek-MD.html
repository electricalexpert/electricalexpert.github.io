<p>Call Mr. Electric's certified electricians for a free evaluation. That's because the store you were in has a standby generator, also known as a backup generator. You can get generators in a wide range of sizes, the largest being for massive power plants that can be used for ages and generate huge amounts of electricity, to small domesticated ones that can generate enough power to home or business.

<p>Journey Worker Electrician - You must show proof of five years and more than 10,000 hours of experience in residential or commercial wiring.

This is a sign that the old electrical wiring in your home isn't able to run enough electricity to appliances.

We only sell and work on whole-house automatic standby generators, not portables.</p>
