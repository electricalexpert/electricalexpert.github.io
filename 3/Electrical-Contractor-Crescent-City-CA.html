Some common sense safety precautions include making sure your hands are dry and not standing in water when performing electrical work or when accessing your electrical panel. We want all our customers to stay safe when using electricity, whether at your home, farm or office. We don't have a qualified or licensed electrician in our company hence I'm trying to get mine so i can do installation as well.</p>

Smart light switches have more electronics packed into them and are bigger than their standard counterparts.

The more light fixtures on a single run of cable and the longer the cable, the greater the voltage drop. That said, most of us don't really know a whole lot about the electricity in our homes.
