<h3>Whole House Generator Installation Pana IL 62557</h3>
<p>Ensuring your electrical systems are up-to-date is a major issue to keep your home safe. The white neutral wire in the new switch box complies with NEC 2011 requirements. Therefore, you want to experience a slight voltage drop to all lamps in your low voltage lighting system. Make sure that you check the age of your electrical panel in your home and consider a circuit panel replacement if your system is 25 years old or older. The simplest installation is one where the power source and new outlet are within the same wall segment but face opposite directions.</p>
<p>This was fine in the past, but homes usually require updated panels to handle the higher payloads of modern-day electronics. Wiring by owners must comply with the same standards as required of Electrical contractors. With our whole house generator installations, you can have peace of mind knowing that no matter what's happening outside your home, you'll be safe and comfortable indoors.
