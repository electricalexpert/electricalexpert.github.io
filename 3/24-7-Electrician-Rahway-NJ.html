<p>They are safe, quiet, and convenient (there's no need to worry about refueling or high costs of using diesel or natural gas). The 12 fixtures are connected with 12-gauge cable and powered by a 300-watt transformer. The average cost of upgrading an electrical panel to A 200 AMP service is $1,500 - 2,800.
