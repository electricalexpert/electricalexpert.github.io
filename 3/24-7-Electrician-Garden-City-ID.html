<p>Note: not all states offer a statewide journeyman electrician license. An electrical contractor can be the bridge between construction and design and actual functionality when you need your appliances and lights flipped back on.

Commonly used devices for managing this pressure in surge protectors include metal oxide varistors (MOV) and gas discharge arrestors, which allow electrical devices to continue operation while diverting excess energy to grounding wires.</p>
