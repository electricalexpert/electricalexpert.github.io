<p>If you notice that your lights frequently dim, especially when you use appliances like microwaves, hair dryers, and air conditioners, your electrical panel may need to be replaced. The hot and neutral wires run from your electrical panel to the device that needs power. It is now code required to also have a neutral conductor at the switch for the use of electronic devices such as smart switches to control the light. Portable generators, true to their name, are easily movable, can be taken from location to location (such as camping trips) and are easily stored in an outdoor shed or garage.</p>
