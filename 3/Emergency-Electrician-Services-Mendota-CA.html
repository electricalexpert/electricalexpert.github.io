<p>The method you choose will depend on the type of fixtures, the distance from the transformer, and the type and size of wire.

We can help you to reduce your utility expenses by installing energy efficient lights or solar lamps. Of course, t is essential that you have proper lighting during the night, especially in outdoor spaces and pathways.</p>
